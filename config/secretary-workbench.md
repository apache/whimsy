Configuring the Secretary Workbench

Install Dependencies
--------------------

Change directory to `whimsy/www/secretary/workbench`

Run:

```
$ bundle install
```

Look for a line that says either `Bundle complete!` or `Bundle updated!`.


Install gpg
-----------

Mac OS/X users can `brew install gpg`.  Linux users likely either already
have this installed, or can make use of the package manager for their operating system.


Install pdftk
-------------
