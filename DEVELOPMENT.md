Preface
=======

Whimsy is a set of independent tools and a common library which typically will
need to access various ASF SVN directories and/or LDAP.  To do development and
testing, you will need access to a machine on which you are willing to install
libraries which do things like access LDAP, XML parsing, ASF Subversion repos,
composing mail and the like for full functionality.

Architecture Overview
========

The core Whimsy code is split into model/view, plus a variety of
tools, some of which use the model, and some completely independent.

1. [lib/whimsy/asf](lib/whimsy/asf) contains the "model", i.e., a set of classes
   which encapsulate access
   to a number of Apache-specific data sources such as LDAP, ICLAs, auth lists, etc.  This
   code originally was developed as a part of separate tools and was later
   refactored out into a common library.  Some of the older tools don't fully
   make use of this refactoring.  See the [whimsy/asf API Docs](https://whimsy.apache.org/docs/api/).

2. [www](www) contains the "view", largely a set of CGI scripts that produce
   HTML.  Generally a CGI script is self contained, including all of the CSS,
   scripts, AJAX logic (client and server), SVG images, etc.  A single script
   may also produce a set (subtree) of web pages.  CGI scripts can be
   identified by their `.cgi` file extension.

   Some of the directories (like the roster tool) contain
   <a name="rackapp">[rack](http://rack.github.io/) applications</a>.  These can be run
   independently, or under the Apache web server through
   the use of [Phusion Passenger](https://www.phusionpassenger.com/).
   Directories containing Rack applications can be identified by the presence
   of a file with the name of `config.ru`.

3. [tools](tools) contains miscellaneous and testing tools, as well as
   scripts that may generate intermediate data files.

4. [config](config) contains some sample configuration data for
   installing various services needed.

5. [www/roster/public\_\*](www/roster) contains a number of scripts run
   by cron jobs or manually that create various data files in
   [www/public on the production instance](https://whimsy.apache.org/public/).

Setup Whimsy Locally
=====

This section is for those desiring to run a whimsy tool on their own machine.
[See below for deploying](#advanced-configuration) in a Docker container or a Vagrant VM,
or read the [detailed macOS setup steps](MACOS.md).

1. **Setup ruby 2.3.x or higher.**  Verify with `ruby -v`.
   If you use a system provided version of Ruby, you may need to prefix
   certain commands (like gem install) with `sudo`.  Alternatives to using
   the system provided version include using a Ruby version manager like
   `rbenv` or `rvm`.  Rbenv generally requires you to be more aware of what you
   are doing (e.g., the need for rbenv shims).  Rvm tends to be more of a set
   and forget operation, but it tends to be more system intrusive (e.g. aliasing
   'cd' in bash).  Note the Whimsy server currently uses **ruby 2.4.1+**.

    For more information:

    1. [Understanding rbenv Shims](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv#understanding-shims)
    2. [Understanding rbenv Binstubs](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv/wiki/Understanding-binstubs)
    3. [Ruby Version Manager - rvm](https://rvm.io/)


2. **Install ruby gems:** `bundler`:

   `gem install bundler`  (mail and listen may be needed too)

   - If you're using [macOS El Capitan or higher](MACOS.md), you may need to do this:

   `sudo gem install bundler -n /usr/local/bin`

   Which installs bundler outside `/usr/bin`

3. **SVN checkout ASF repositories** into (or linked to from)
   `/srv/svn` (only some tools require these)

        svn co --depth=files https://svn.apache.org/repos/private/foundation

   You can specify an alternate location for these directories by placing
   a YAML [configuration file](CONFIGURE.md) named `.whimsy` in your home
   directory  An minimal example (be sure to include the dashed lines!):

        :svn:
        - /home/rubys/svn/foundation
        - /home/rubys/svn/committers

   See repository.yml for a full list of repos needed.  Different tools
   require different local checkouts to function; some require git clone.

4. **Configure LDAP** servers and certificates:
<a name="ldapconfig"> </a>

    1. The model code determines what host and port to connect to by parsing
      either `/etc/ldap/ldap.conf` or `/etc/openldap/ldap.conf` for a line that
      looks like the following (the host name may be different):
        `uri     ldaps://ldap-us.apache.org:636`

    2. A `TLS_CACERT` can be obtained via either of the following commands:

        - `ruby -r whimsy/asf -e "puts ASF::LDAP.extract_cert"`
        - `openssl s_client -connect ldap-us-ro.apache.org:636 </dev/null`

      For openssl, copy from the LAST `BEGIN` to `END` inclusive into the file `/etc/ldap/asf-ldap-client.pem`.
      Point to the file in `/etc/ldap/ldap.conf` with a line like the following:

      `TLS_CACERT      /etc/ldap/asf-ldap-client.pem`

     If multiple different certificates are needed, they should all be added to the same file.
     [The option `TLS_CACERTDIR` is not used Ubuntu for example]

      N.B. OpenLDAP on macOS uses `/etc/openldap/` instead of `/etc/ldap/`
      Adjust the paths above as necessary.
      Also (on Catalina at least), macOS uses SecureTransport.
      This means that `TLS_CACERT` is not used.
      Instead use the `TLS_TRUSTED_CERTS` option. See: `man 5 ldap.conf`
      This requires the certificates to have been installed into the system key chain,
      so it is much easier to ensure that `TLS_REQCERT` is set to `allow`.

      Note: the certificate is needed because the ASF LDAP hosts use a
      self-signed certificate. Certificates may also be needed for test LDAP instances
      if the CA is not in the built-in list.

      Simple way to configure LDAP is:

        sudo ruby -r whimsy/asf -e "ASF::LDAP.configure"

      The ASF now uses fixed names for its LDAP servers.
      However there may be changes to the certificates from time to time.
      If you override the defaults in the `~/.whimsy` file, you may need to adjust the settings.

1. **Verify your configuration** by running:

   `ruby examples/board.rb`

   It should print out an HTML page with current board members.
   See comments in the `board.rb` file for running the script as a
   standalone server to view in a local web browser.  This test script
   verifies the environment used by many, but not all, Whimsy tools.

2. **Configure mail sending** :mailbox_with_mail: (_optional_):

   Configuration of outbound mail delivery is done through the `~/.whimsy`
   file.  Three examples are provided below, followed by links to where
   documentation of the parameters can be found.

        :sendmail:
          delivery_method: sendmail

        :sendmail:
          delivery_method: smtp
          address: smtp-server.nc.rr.com
          domain:  intertwingly.net

        :sendmail:
          delivery_method: smtp
          address: smtp.gmail.com
          port: 587
          domain: apache.org
          user_name: username
          password: password
          authentication: plain
          enable_starttls_auto: true

   For more details, see the mail gem documentation for
   [smtp](http://www.rubydoc.info/github/mikel/mail/Mail/SMTP),
   [exim](http://www.rubydoc.info/github/mikel/mail/Mail/Exim),
   [sendmail](http://www.rubydoc.info/github/mikel/mail/Mail/Sendmail),
   [testmailer](http://www.rubydoc.info/github/mikel/mail/Mail/TestMailer), and
   [filedelivery](http://www.rubydoc.info/github/mikel/mail/Mail/FileDelivery)

Running Whimsy Applications :car:
============================

If there is a `Gemfile` in the directory containing the script or application
you wish to run, dependencies needed for execution can be installed using the
command `bundle install`.  Similarly, if starting from scratch you
may need `gem install rake`.  Periodically if underlying gems like
wunderbar are updated, you may need `bundle update`.  
See also [How To: Keep Your Local Environment Updated](#how-to-keep-your-local-environment-updated)

1. CGI applications can be run from a command line, and produce output to
   standard out.  If you would prefer to see the output in a browser, you
   will need to have a web server configured to run CGI, and a small CGI
   script which runs your application.  For CGI scripts (chmod 755) that make use of
   wunderbar, this script can be generated and installed for you by
   passing a `--install` option on the command, for example:

       ruby examples/board.rb --install=~/Sites/

   Note that by default CGI scripts run as a user with a different home
   directory very little privileges.  You may need to copy or symlink your
   `~/.whimsy` file and/or run using
   [suexec](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/suexec.html).

2. [Rack applications](#rackapp) can be run as a standalone web server.  If a `Rakefile`
   is provided, the convention is that `rake server` will start the server,
   typically with listeners that will automatically restart the application
   if any source file changes.  If a `Rakefile` isn't present, the `rackup`
   command can be used to start the application.

   If you are testing an application that makes changes to LDAP, you will
   need to enter your ASF password.  To do so, substitute `rake auth server`
   for the `rake server` command above.  This will prompt you for your
   password.  Should your ASF availid differ from your local user id,
   set the `USER` environment variable prior to executing this command.

Advanced Configuration
======================

Setting things up so that the **entire** whimsy website is available as
a virtual host, complete with authentication:

1. Install passenger by running either running
   `passenger-install-apache2-module` and following its instructions, or
   by visiting https://www.phusionpassenger.com/library/install/apache/install/oss/.

   a. If using rbenv, make sure to add your `~/.rbenv/shims` directory to the PATH environment variable.

2. Visit [vhost-generator](https://whimsy.apache.org/test/vhost-generator) to
   generate a custom a vhost definition, and to see which apache modules need
   to be installed.

   a. On Ubuntu, place the generated vhost definition into
      `/etc/apache2/sites-available` and enable the site using `a2ensite`.
      Enable the modules you need using `a2ensite`.  Restart the Apache httpd
      web server using `service apache2 restart`.

   b. [On macOS](MACOS.md), place the generated vhost definition into
      `/private/etc/apache2/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf`.  Edit
      `/etc/apache2/httpd.conf` and uncomment out the line that includes
      `httpd-vhosts.conf`, and
      enable the modules you need by uncommenting out the associated lines.
      Restart the Apache httpd web server using `apachectl restart`.

3. (Optional) run a service that will restart your passenger applications
   whenever the source to that application is modified.  On Ubuntu, this is
   done  by creating a `~/.config/upstart/whimsy-listener` file with the
   following contents:

       description "listen for changes to whimsy applications"
       start on dbus SIGNAL=SessionNew
       exec /srv/whimsy/tools/toucher

4. (Optional) Debug your local Whimsy web environment with two scripts:

       localhost:port/test.cgi?debug
       localhost:port/racktest

More details about the production Whimsy instance are in [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md)

Documentation Standards
============

As a collection of semi-independent tools, Whimsy has a number of
different ways to document code or functionality for users.

- **RDoc for whimsy/asf module APIs** The Rakefile has an RDoc task that now
  processes the lib/whimsy/ directory, which can be run locally, and
  is run automatically on the server into https://whimsy.apache.org/docs/api/

- **End user instructions** are provided in many tools by defining a
  `PAGETITLE` and a `helpblock ->` which are put into a consistent place
  on the page for users when using whimsy/asf/themes.  This information
  is also parsed to generate a committer-only
  [listing of useful Whimsy tools](https://whimsy.apache.org/committers/tools).

- **Data dependencies** and the flow of data between different Whimsy
  processes and other websites are described in [test/dataflow.cgi](https://whimsy.apache.org/test/dataflow.cgi)

- **How-To for whimsy committers** are what you're reading right here
  in DEVELOPMENT.md and in DEPLOYMENT.md, CONFIGURE.md, MACOS.md


How To / FAQ :question:
============

### How To: Create A New Whimsy CGI

The simplest way to create a new standalone tool is copy an existing .cgi.
Important things to check:

- chmod 755 is likely needed
- Double-check paths to the lib/asf files (which you will be using a lot)
- Test locally first; in production logs are in [/members/log](https://whimsy.apache.org/members/log/)

### How To: Use New SVN or Git Directories

Some SVN/Git repos/files are checked out via cron jobs regularly for
caching and read only access.  Some applications checkout needed files
just when running into temp dirs (typically to modify them and commit
changes).  If you have trouble using the existing [ASF::SVN classes](lib/whimsy/asf/svn.rb)
class to access files from Subversion on the server, then check:

- Default SVN checkout mappings: [repository.yml](repository.yml)

### How To: Keep Your Local Environment Updated

`rake update git:pull svn:update` will crawl the tree, updating all
gems as well as pulling/updating any existing git or svn checkouts that
you have locally from repository.yml.

Note also that sometimes you may need to `bundle exec *command*` instead
of just doing `bundle *command*`, since using the exec uses a subtly
different set of gem versions from the local directory.

### How To: Authenticate/Authorize Your Scripts

User authentication for any CGI script is provided by the http server's
LDAP module, and can be done by by adding the path to the CGI in the
deployment descriptor for the server under the appropriate `authldap` realm:

https://github.com/apache/infrastructure-puppet/blob/deployment/data/nodes/whimsy-vm4.apache.org.yaml#L127

Note that the LDAP module does not currently handle boolean conditions
(example: members **or** officers).  The way to handle this is to do
authentication in two passes.  The first pass will be done by the Apache
http server, and verify that the user is a part of the most inclusive group
(typically: committers).  That is done as above in `authldap`.

The CGI scripts that need to do more specific authorization will need to
check `ASF::Auth` in their code, and output a "Status: 401 Unauthorized"
line if access to the tool is **not** permitted for the user.

```ruby
require 'whimsy/asf/rack' # Ensures server auth is passed thru
require 'whimsy/asf' # Provides ASF::Auth class

user = ASF::Auth.decode(env = {})
unless user.asf_member? or ASF.pmc_chairs.include? user
  print "Status: 401 Unauthorized\r\n"
  print "WWW-Authenticate: Basic realm=\"ASF Members and Officers\"\r\n\r\n"
  exit
end
```

### How To: Add A New Mailing List-Id

Whimsy can use ASF::Mail to view mailing lists locally by having the
server subscribe to the list.

- Subscribe _listname_@whimsy-_server_vmname_.apache.org to the desired
  mailing list (see also [Deployment instructions](DEPLOYMENT.md#manual-steps))
- Add your _listname_ to the `:apache_mailmap:` entry in [puppet](https://github.com/apache/infrastructure-puppet/blob/deployment/data/nodes/whimsy-vm4.apache.org.yaml#L63)
- Note that tools/deliver.rb will dump all mail locally (it does not
  currently get cleaned out) where it can be used by ASF::Mail

### How To: Test Whimsy Library methods

The following alias runs Interactive Ruby (irb) with the Whimsy library preloaded:

    alias wrb='irb -I /srv/whimsy/lib -r whimsy/asf'

To control Wunderbar logging, it may be useful to create the following file:

```$ cat ~/.irbrc
require 'pp' # if desired
# Set up Wunderbar logging if running wrb
if $LOAD_PATH.include?("/srv/whimsy/lib") # using wrb?
  puts "#{__FILE__} - setting log_level=info"
  require 'wunderbar' # it has not been loaded yet
  Wunderbar.log_level="info"
end
```

Simple shell scripts can use the following:

    #!/usr/bin/env ruby
    $LOAD_PATH.unshift '/srv/whimsy/lib'
    require 'whimsy/asf'

Adjust the paths above if you have not installed code in the standard place
(or add a link from /srv/whimsy to your copy of the code)

### How To: Match Email Addresses To Committers

```ruby
require 'whimsy/asf'
require 'mail'

from = 'Shane Curcuru <asf@shanecurcuru.org>'
address = Mail::Address.new(from)
person = ASF::Person.find_by_email(address.address.dup)
p person # -> nil or an ASF::Person object
```

### How To: Have A CGI Create either HTML or JSON Output

Often times Whimsy CGIs display visualizations of JSON or other structured
data that is generated from various other sources.  It's handy to have
one script both create the JSON (to checkin to /public, perhaps) as well
as display the data.

One example of this is the [trademark listing script](www/brand/list.cgi),
which explicitly checks the query string to determine which output to send.

```ruby
# return output in JSON format if the query string includes 'json'
ENV['HTTP_ACCEPT'] = 'application/json' if ENV['QUERY_STRING'].include? 'json'

_json do
  # Gather data and return JSON object
end

# Normal script to output to browsers
_html do
  _body? do
...etc.
```

Scripts that don't do the query string check can still be forced to have
wunderbar return the _json data instead of _html via curl:

    curl -i -H "Accept: application/json" -u curcuru https://whimsy.apache.org/members/private-script.cgi

This will prompt for a password interactively, and then cause the
script to return _json to curl.

Whimsy On Windows
=================

While some tools may work on Microsoft Windows, many don't currently.  
Alternatives for Windows include a Docker image, a custom Vagrant VM, and a Kitchen/Puppet
managed Vagrant VM (as the [live instance](DEPLOYMENT.md) does).  The primary advantage
of using an image or a VM is isolation.  The primary disadvantage is that
you will need to install your SVN credentials there and arrange to either
duplicate or mount needed SVN directories.

Further Reading
===============

The [board agenda](www/board/agenda) application
is an example of a complete tool that makes extensive use of the library
factoring, has a suite of test cases, and client componentization (using
ReactJS), and provides instructions for setting up both a Docker component and
a Vagrant VM.  There are [custom setup steps](config/board-agenda.md) to run it locally.

If you would like to understand how the view code works, you can get started
by looking at a few of the
[Wunderbar demos](https://github.com/rubys/wunderbar/tree/master/demo)
and [README](https://github.com/rubys/wunderbar/blob/master/README.md).
