Subject: ASF Board Report - Initial Reminder for [month] [year]

This email was sent on behalf of the ASF Board.  It is an initial reminder to
give you plenty of time to prepare the report.

The meeting is scheduled for [meetingDate] and the deadline for
submitting your report is 1 full week prior to that ([dueDate])!

According to board records, you are listed as the chair of at least one
committee that is due to submit a report this month. [1] [2]

Details on which project reports are due and how to submit a report 
are enclosed below.

Please submit your report with sufficient time to allow the board members
to review and digest. Again, the very latest you should submit your report
is 1 full week (7days) prior to the board meeting ([dueDate]).

If you feel that an error has been made, please consult [1] and if there
is still an issue then contact the board directly.

As always, PMC chairs are welcome to attend the board meeting.

Thanks,
The ASF Board

Submitting your Report
----------------------

Full details about the process and schedule are in [1].

The report should be committed to the meeting agenda in the board directory
in the foundation repository, trying to keep a similar format to the others.
This can be found at:

  https://svn.apache.org/repos/private/foundation/board

Reports can also be posted using the online agenda tool:

  [agenda][link]

Your report should also be sent in plain-text format to [whoTo]
with a Subject line that follows the below format:

  Subject: [REPORT] [project] - [month] [year]

Cutting and pasting directly from a Wiki is not acceptable due to formatting
issues. Line lengths should be limited to 77 characters.

Chairs may use the Apache Reporter Service [4] to help them compile and
submit a board report.


Resolutions
-----------

There are several templates for use for various Board resolutions.
They can be found in [3] and you are encouraged to use them. It is
strongly recommended that if you have a resolution before the board,
you are encouraged to attend that board meeting.
