Notes
=====
It might be useful to be able to attach a note to some requests:

Messages sent to *-owner
=========================
Moderators also see messages sent to the -owner address
Most of these are spam and should be ignored,
but there may occasionally be an enquiry that needs a reply
(Note: such messages won't have a standard format, and parsing may need adjusting)
