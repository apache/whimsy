This email was sent on behalf of the ASF Board.

According to board records, you are listed as the chair of a committee that
is due to submit a report this month. These reports are now due and should
be submitted to the board as soon as possible but no later than
[dueDate].

The meeting is scheduled for [meetingDate].
Times in other time zones:

  [timeZoneInfo]

Full details about the process and schedule are in [1]. Details about what a
report should look like can be found at:

  https://www.apache.org/foundation/board/reporting

The report should be committed to the meeting agenda in the board directory
in the foundation repository, trying to keep a similar format to the others.
This can be found at:

  https://svn.apache.org/repos/private/foundation/board

Reports can also be posted using the online agenda tool:

  [agenda][link]

Your report should also be sent in plain-text format to [whoTo]
with a Subject line that follows the below format:

  Subject: [REPORT] [project] - [month] [year]

Cutting and pasting directly from a Wiki is not acceptable due to formatting
issues. Line lengths should be limited to 77 characters.

Chairs may use the Apache Reporter Service [3] to help them compile and
submit a board report.

As always, PMC chairs are welcome to attend the board meeting.

Thanks,
The ASF Board
