 4. Executive Officer Reports

    A. Chairman [Brett]

       Happy New Year!

       Following on from the discussion about budget timing, an early Annual
       Members Meeting has been suggested. This would require starting the
       process in the next week or two. We will also need to work through the
       questions about quorum raised at the 2014 meeting.

       Several other discussions have started among the board this month, but
       have been pushed out to committees such as Community Development and
       the Incubator.

       We have a higher than normal number of reports missing this month,
       likely due to the missing reminder emails and the holiday period.

    B. President [Ross]

       It's budget planning season. All officers should send their request to me
       ASAP. The current timeline is:

         - Jan: Deliver a draft budget based on 2014 budget actuals (Virtual)
         - Feb: Deliver a draft budget adjusted based on Officer input
             (President) 
         - March: Deliver a draft budget for comment by the outgoing board
             (President)
         - April: Deliver final budget for approval by the incoming
             board (President) 

       In the March and April deliverables I plan to also provide a 5 year budget
       proposal. This will be used for planning purposes only and will not be voted
       on by the board (though comments will be incorporated wherever appropriate).

       EA contract has been renewed. This again brought the issue of contractor vs
       employee to the fore. From a management perspective we are in good shape
       (though I'm working with Virtual to change the contract to reflect this). 
       However, since Melissa is working 40 hours per week and has no other job it is
       hard to argue that, under IRS rules, she would be considered a contractor.

       My previous recommendation was to use Virtual services to resolve this issue. 
       This was not supported by the board, however the problem still exists today. 
       Furthermore, VP Infrastructure has a couple of similar contracts due for
       renewal. Greg is looking at a proposal to address this and will hopefully be
       able to provide an update today. In the interim I again recommend that we use
       virtual to resolve this problem, even is this is a short term solution while a
       long term one is identified and implemented.

       Brand manage report is missing at the time of writing. I am not aware of any
       significant issues. The move to allowing PMCs to manage requests clearly
       within the policies identified by VP Brand Management seems to be taking
       effect, with less trivial requests reaching the brand mailing list and thus a
       seemingly more rapid response to more complex issues.

       The fundraising report is missing at the time of writing. The new VPs are
       getting up to speed and communications with sponsors are being managed well. 
       With Hadrian's engagement our EA is pushing forward to formalize a proposal
       for an OfBiz based CRM solution for the fundraising team. At the same time a
       member of the OfBiz community has expressed interest on the ComDev list in
       helping the foundation. I've made everyone aware of the interest and
       encouraged discussion on the fundraising lists. in the meantime we are
       continuing to spec and cost a service.

       Sally (VP Marketing) has provided some mock-ups for an alternative to the
       "fork me on GitHub" banners in response to discussions on the board@ list. 
       These are intended to progress the discussion and will be shared with the
       Wicket PMC for feedback first. Sally is also finalizing the first draft of the
       quarterly report. This is due for publication before the next board meeting. 
       Other Marketing items are "business as usual".

       Infrastructure report is missing at the time of writing. There are two items
       I'm aware of, the first is the contract status for renewals (discussed above),
       the second is the budgeting process. David (VP Infrastructure) and I are
       working on classifying services and budgeting according to their importance
       and the expected growth of the foundation.

       Travel Assistance Committee report is missing at the time of writing. EA
       reports that TAC applications are underway for ApacheCon NA (close Feb 6th)


       Directed Sponsorship
       -----------------------------

       As discussed on the board@ list I would like to proceed with a limited
       experiment allowing directed sponsorship, that is sponsorship that is only
       used to support a specific project.  My motivation is that a PMC has claimed
       they were unaware of the willingness of the board to entertain the concept of
       directed sponsorships. This has, arguably, resulted in a lost opportunity to
       empower a PMC through directed sponsorships. My goal here is to remove all
       doubt about the willingness of the ASF Board to conduct a controlled
       experiment in order to inform a future policy for all PMCs. I do not intend
       for this experiment to set a precedent, only to provide valuable data. Note,
       there is currently no PMC in a position to take advantage of this. If this
       remains the case that will be valuable data in itself.

       I have consulted with Virtual and have been informed that there are no
       concerns relating to our 501c(3) status (although we would still need to
       ensure a projects use of directed sponsorship is appropriate). Virtual have
       also confirmed that they can support this proposed experiment with no
       additional cost.

       One important item to note is that this proposal does not enable a PMC to have
       a "donate" button for small contributions. The overhead in dealing with small
       donations is too high.

       Proposal:

       - The ASF will continue to provide essential services for core funding using
       the existing sponsorship model, this proposal does not change that arrangement

       - During this experiment a maximum of two PMCs will be given permission to
       solicit directed sponsorships with a minimum donation level of $50,000.

       - Projects are free to use directed funds to deliver additional services
       not provided from core ASF funds if, and only if, VPs Fundraising have
       approved this use 

       - Any directed sponsorships will have a total of 15% contributed to ASF
       central funds to pay for essential maintenance of core services

       - Where the sponsor is already a foundation sponsor the 15% core
       contribution will be reduced by the total of the existing sponsorship amount

       - Existing sponsorship of the foundation cannot be reclassified as a
       directed sponsorship

       - Directed sponsorships will (optionally) receive credit on the “thanks” page
       at the level of their 15% core donation with a note that they are also a
       project sponsor

       - Receiving projects may choose to manage their own thanks page under
       guidelines drawn up by VP Fundraising and VP Brand Management

       - Sponsorships will be assumed to be for 12 months, any unspent funds at the
       end of 12 months will become ASF foundation funds if the ASF chooses. Sponsors
       will agree to this in writing.

       - Sponsorships are not refundable if the project leaves the ASF, retires
       to the Attic or fails to use the funds. All unspent funds will be transferred
       to core ASF funds.

       - Sponsors can dictate which PMC the money is directed towards but not what
       the money is to be used for, it is the PMC that decide what it is used for.

       - Any requested use by the PMC must be in conformance with the policies and
       practices of the ASF, where policy is not clearly defined VPs Fundraising
       approval will be required (for example, directed sponsorships cannot be used
       to develop code).

       - The President, VPs Fundraising and PMC Chair will work directly with
       potential sponsors to ensure they are fully aware of what is and is not
       possible with their donated funds (for example, code development is explicitly
       prohibited )

       - Any service that adds to the workload of the ASF contractors or VPs will
       require an appropriate contribution to ASF funds to cover these costs

       - No use of the funds that would put the ASF 501c(3) status at risk will be
       permitted

       Additionally, please see Attachments 1 through 6.

    C. Treasurer [Chris]
    
        The Treasurer’s Office worked with Virtual to get the Apache 990
        and Client Organizer submitted and Taxes filed.
        
        New Credit Cards from Citizen’s Bank have been received by the
        Treasurer, VP Infrastructure, the President, the EVP, the EA and
        the ASF Secretary.
        
        There are a few outstanding actions, including closing down the WF
        accounts. Chris and Tom from Virtual will meet in the coming month
        and report back.
        
        VP, Press and Marketing has asked for Quarterly Financial Reports
        - Virtual is picking up this action and coordinating with Sally on
        this front.

    D. Secretary [Craig]

       Secretary is running well. An issue with submissions of modified license
       agreements was resolved to everyone’s satisfaction, with no changes to license
       agreements necessary.

       In December, 57 iclas, eight cclas, and one nda were received and filed.

    E. Executive Vice President [Rich]

        This month I've been working on finding keynotes for
        ApacheCon, and trying to get various project communities to
        promote the CFP and seek speakers. Thus far, we have less than
        50 talks proposed, however, we've traditionally seen half to
        two thirds of proposals come in during the last week.

        The CFP closes on Feb 1, so the coming month will be spent in
        the selection process and other logistics around planning the
        event.

        I've also been working with the people at OpenSource.com (as
        has Sally) to identify people within the Apache community to
        write for the 'Apache Quill' series that they'll be running
        for as long as we cam provide content.

    F. Vice Chairman [Greg]

       Options for handling our service provider contracts have been gathered from
       discussions and placed into version control. Refinement is now occurring, and
       expansion on the best options.

       At the moment, the two best options are to use Virtual's PEO (Professional
       Employment Organization) or to contract with a (corporate) third-party for our
       services.

Attachment 1: Report from the Executive Assistant  [Melissa Warnkin]

Fundraising/Virtual: 
• Credit cards have all been received and activated
• $65k received in sponsorship payments; Obtained a new silver sponsor this
past month, and there are two new requests for info on becoming a sponsor (one
silver, the other not specified)
• CRM for Fundraising – Hot Wax Media putting together a team to start working
on the CRM this week Misc:
• Stickers ordered for Jan I for FOSDEM and European events
• Apache Bigtop stickers ordered for Kostantin


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 2: Report from the VP of Brand Management  [Shane Curcuru]

The Apache CloudStack PMC is working with the Linux Foundation (LF) directly
with the aim of setting up a CloudStack Marketing Alliance, outside of the
ASF, to help promote the use and development of CloudStack.  The PMC and LF
representatives are working within our published brand policy, and are working
with relevant ASF officers when needed. This looks to be a very productive
start to this PMC's long-running broader work around showcasing CloudStack to
the public, and should provide good experiences and models for other PMCs
wishing to broaden their outreach.

Several other PMCs have begun directly issuing permissions for small/mid scale
events using their marks, so the process of PMC permissions is starting to be
used, although more education and clearer documentation is still very much
needed.

Submitted a USPTO registration for FLINK at the request of the newly graduated
PMC.

The ASF received the formal trademark registration paperwork for our HADOOP
registration in Japan.

With assistance of counsel and many other ASF'ers, updated and signed an event
MOU with Cloudera for their ongoing Hadoop World conference.  

trademarks@ lost Jukka as a moderator.  While Henri volunteered to fill in,
the lack of any other volunteers is concerning for the long term with the
relatively small number of Members who regularly step up to help productively
work on trademarks@ matters.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 3: Report from the VP of Fundraising  [Jim Jagielski]

Much of what happened in the Fundraising realm is captured on Melissa's report.

* We had a few discussions about the CRM issue with Melissa and Rob. I am
  waiting on the HotWax Media response, but it's very likely that I will
  reach out to the Ofbiz community for a pilot project.
* We started a conversation about improving the Thanks page. Daniel came up
  with a nice proposal. Looks like we'll soon declare lazy consensus and go
  with his rendering.
* We are continuing the renewal process normally.
* We identified new potential sponsors (a CRM, again, would help)
* We are looking into ways to conduct fundraising campaigns in ways
  compatible with ASF's values.
* Hadrian asked to be associated with the ASF on GuideStar (don't know yet if
  their GS Exchange is an appropriate avenue).

Attachment 4: Report from the VP of Marketing and Publicity  [Sally Khudairi]

I. Budget: Sally Khudairi submitted two NASDAQ GlobeNewswire invoices to the
ASF/Virtual accounting team for payment for press releases that fell out of
the pre-paid contract timeframe (two week period between contract termination
and renewal). She has also been working with Melissa Warnkin on production of
several promotional projects (such as stickers for FOSDEM and SCALE
conferences), for which Melissa has forwarded the credit card receipts for
ASF/Virtual's deduction from the M&P budget.

II. Fundraising/Branding/Marketing liaison: no new formal projects or
developments at this time. Sally continues to liaise with Trademarks & Brand
Management with usage requests. She is also working on the first of the ASF's
quarter annual reports, which is scheduled to be published at the end of
January.

III. Press Releases: the following formal announcements were issued via the
newswire service, ASF Foundation Blog, and announce@apache.org during this
timeframe: 

 - 19 January 2015 --The Apache Software Foundation Announces Apache™ Falcon™
   as a Top-Level Project
 - 12 January 2015 --The Apache Software Foundation Announces Apache™ Flink™
   as a Top-Level Project

 
IV. Informal Announcements: 10 items were published on the ASF "Foundation"
Blog and tweeted on @TheASF, including the ASF's new Code of Conduct
http://s.apache.org/dGR and the addition of Apache sub-projects being added to
the Foundation's official activity count http://s.apache.org/fs5 . An
additional 13 items were tweeted on @TheASF. Six Apache News Round-ups were
issued, with a total of 18 weekly summaries published thus far. 

V. Future Announcements: two announcements are in development, one for a new
TLP and the other for Apache PDFBox. Sally is working on new promotional
guidelines for podlings both entering as well as those ready to graduate from
the Incubator, and will be coordinating with Roman Shaposhnik on publishing
them when ready. Those PMCs wishing to announce major project news are welcome
to contact Sally at <press@apache.org> for more information. Kindly provide at
least 2-weeks' notice for proper planning and execution.


VI. Media Relations: we responded to 7 media requests. The ASF received 696
press clips over this time period, vs. last month's clip count of 2,271.

VII. Analyst Relations: we responded to 4 analyst queries. Apache was
mentioned in 26 write-ups by Gartner, 3 reports by Forrester, 3 write-up by
GigaOM, 3 reports by 451 Research/Yankee Group, and 6 reports by IDC. Sally is
working with Forrester on a new report on Apache Spark. 

VIII. ApacheCon liaison: Sally continues to work with Ross Gardler on creating
an ASF-wide marketing campaign that can be mapped against the tracks at
ApacheCon. They are also working with Rich Bowen with targeting possible
keynote themes and speakers.

IX. (Non-ASF) Industry Events and Outreach liaison: no formal activities at
this time. 

X. Newswire accounts: we have 29 pre-paid press releases with NASDAQ
GlobeNewswire through the end of 2016, and continue to receive gratis news
release distribution in the UK by Pressat.

Attachment 5: Report from the VP of Infrastructure  [David Nalley]

New Karma:
==========


Finances:
==========
1429.14 - Amazon Web Services
3969.00 - Carbonite/Zmanda

As a side note, the new cards have arrived, which provide a much
better level of insight into spending; many thanks to the office 
of Treasurer and EA for chasing this.  
 
Operations Action Items:
========================

N/A

Short Term Priorities:
======================

Codesigning
-----------
Another project has requested code signing functionality. (UIMA
INFRA-9002). 
Four signing events occurred in the month. Two events each for Tomcat
8.0.16 and 8.0.17. 

Machine deprecation
-------------------
Work continues (and was slightly hindered by the holidays) on
deprecating the host the runs the writable git service and bugzilla.

Backups
-------
Over the past several months we've found a number of services where
backups were either failing or not happening at all. We've spent a
good deal of time focusing on auditing backups and looking for a new
solution that gives us better visibility into the success or failure
of backup jobs. To that end we've selected Zmanda as our platform
of choice and have begun deploying it. 

LDAP
----

LDAP has emerged as a priority during this month. The loss of the
machine that served as the svn master last month reduced the number of
LDAP servers in our Oregon Colo to 1, and that instance is
consistently under heavy load, and logins to most services are taking
significantly longer as a result. We've had a lot of work in process, 
and only recently began tackling the issue. 

Long Range Priorities:
======================

Monitoring
----------

Work is continuing on monitoring, with a good leap forward this month.
We are taking advantage of (and contrbuting to) a project by the name
of dsnmp that queries the Dell OpenManage SNMP/WBEM frameworks as well
as the overall operating system health for machine. This provides
status checking to alert us to issues that have frequently resulted in
outages or service degradation. This month we were alerted to multiple
issues that we were able to address before they resulted in outages.
This is not a panacea, nor are we done with monitoring efforts, but we
are in a much better position now. 

Automation
----------
Automation progress continued, though slowed somewhat by the holidays.
The writable git service is now handled by configuration management. 
 
Currently the following services are in progress or in final stages of
testing: 
blogs.a.o
Bugzilla

Resilience
----------

We haven't made much progress on this front in the past month, aside
from th ongoing automation efforts. 

Technical Debt
--------------

As part of our automation efforts, we've been able to generate
recreatable Debian packages for our customized version of Bugzilla.
The long term plan is for us to have a private build job that builds
new packages anytime the source code in our tree for Bugzilla is
modified. 

General Activity:
=================

We continue to explore the package repository service and have folks
from Cassandra currently working on moving their existing deb
repository from www.a.o/dist to this service as a pilot. Traffic about
the pilot has generated interest from other projects. 

Addressing a long standing todo that came out of the Heartbleed
vulnerability, we now have an enterprise account with Symantec
that will allow us to provision certs on demand with no interaction
required for apache.org and openoffice.org. 

We've migrated a traffic intensive service from one provider to
another to minimize our cloud hosting expenses. (Currently 3/4 of our
cloud infrastructure expense is from egress traffic). The new provider
has a different fee structure that should result in noticeably lower 
service charges. 

Maven has requested, and we've agreed to host, an ASF copy of the
Maven Central repository from Sonatype. Work is starting around that,
but is still early. This is expected to cost in the range of $600 per
annum.   

We began discussing deprecating translate.apache.org as the service is
provided for only 4 projects, and has only one volunteer doing the work
of administering the service. Additionally, a number of l10n services 
advertise free l10n hosting for OSS projects. Many of our projects are 
already making use of those free offerings.  

Uptime Statistics:
==================
We have revamped our uptime charts a bit, added some services and removed some
deprecated ones. Our current overall target is 98.59% for these samples. This
month, the overall uptime was 99.61% with critical services achieving 99.81%.
All of the downtime here was due to moving the writeable git repos to a new
machine.


Type:                   Target:   Reality:   Target Met:
---------------------------------------------------------
Critical services:      99.50%    99.81%        Yes
Core services:          99.00%    99.66%        Yes
Standard services:      95.00%    99.18%        Yes
---------------------------------------------------------
Overall:                98.59%    99.57%        Yes

Attachment 8: Report from the Apache Legal Affairs Committee  [Jim Jagielski]

There was some discussion regarding cleaning-up our external documentation,
regarding 3rd party license capability and ensuring that people are directed
to the latest official policies; This effort is in the process of being
completed.

JIRA-based issues are being handled as required.

Nothing at this time for board action.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment 9: Report from the Apache Security Team Project  [Mark Cox]

We see a number of confused messages come to security@ every week
where people say they have been hacked, or they never installed our
software.  These were different to what happened in previous years
when people saw "powered by Apache" on a web page that was in outage
and thought we'd hacked them.  

In December we emailed a number of these people (we usually ignore
them) to try to figure out what they were seeing.  Only one responsed
to me, and we figured out that what they saw was a license page for
"Guava" on their Android mobile.  The Guava license mentions it's
under the Apache License.  The user didn't know what Guava was, didn't
remember installing it (they didn't), and assumed that whatever other
things were happening on their handset was the result of this
software.

Aside from these; there continues to be a steady stream of reports of
various kinds arriving at security@. These continue to be dealt with
by the security team.

December 2014

Attachment A: Report from the Apache Abdera Project  [Ant Elder]

Apache Abdera provides Java implementations of the IETF Atom
Syndication Format and Publishing Protocol specifications.

Abdera is very very quiet with no activity for months, and I've been
missing doing the board reports for it. A few months ago i asked if
someone else would volunteer to be chair but had no offers, I've asked
again now and if no one steps up again by the next report i'll propose
the project is moved to the Attic.

No board issues.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment B: Report from the Apache Accumulo Project  [Billie Rinaldi]

The Apache Accumulo sorted, distributed key/value store is a robust,
scalable, high performance data storage system that features cell-based
access control and customizable server-side processing.  It is based on
Google's BigTable design and is built on top of Apache Hadoop,
Zookeeper, and Thrift.

Releases
Version 1.6.1 was released on 9/24/2014.
No releases have been made since the last report.

Activity
For the first time, the numbers of subscribers to both the dev and user
lists have decreased slightly.  The dev and commits lists are
maintaining steady activity, while the user list activity has decreased.
The average number of messages per month for August - December 2014 is 
roughly half that of the preceding six months.  Most months, we are
still seeing upwards of 70 messages per month to the user list.

We are planning to release 1.6.2 very soon and 1.7.0 moderately soon.

Community
Sean Busbey was added as a committer and PMC member on 1/09/2014.
No new committers have been added since the last report, but we are
actively discussing how to grow our community.

The second annual Accumulo conference has been scheduled for April [1].

In late November into December we experienced what might have been our
first vehement disagreement over a code change.  The issue was
ultimately resolved amicably.  One notable outcome of the process was a
decision by our community to adopt semantic versioning 2.0 for our
releases.

Attachment J: Report from the Apache Axis Project  [Deepal Jayasinghe]


-----------------------------------------
Attachment K: Report from the Apache BookKeeper Project  [Ivan Kelly]

BookKeeper is a distributed, reliable, and high performance
logging service. The project also includes Hedwig which is
a highly scalable Pub/Sub service built on top of ZooKeeper
and BookKeeper with strong durability guarantees.

= Project Status =
Development activity has been low over the last month due to the holiday
season. We have been having discussions on how to improve the project
visibility and attract new contributors. One angle we will take is to improve
our documentation to flatten the learning curve for new comers to the
project. We also intend to do more public talks and blog posts, publicizing
the production usecases that already exist.

We plan to submit one talk to ApacheCon NA. We have also been working with
press@a.o to create a press release announcing the BookKeeper TLP. All that
is required now for this, is approval from the relevant press offices in the
companies mentioned, and it's ready to go.

= Releases =
Our last release was 4.3.0, released on 2014-10-14. 

Release 4.2.4 is currently being voted on, so we expect it to be released in
the next week.
We are currently working on the 4.3.1 release also, which should follow soon
after 4.2.4.

= Community Status =
There have been no committers added since we became TLP (2014-11-19).

The last committer added, when we were a subproject, was Rakesh
Radhakrishnan on 24th July 2014.

49 subscribers in dev@bookkeeper.apache.org

--------------

The project has been moving at a slightly slower pace than in past quarters.
Since the last board report there have been 15 new issues logged in Jira, with
8 of them being closed in that time. Similar to the previous couple of board
reports, the majority of recent work has been focused on minor improvements
and bug fixes.

A particularly interesting recent jira ticket was the donation of a number of
Crunch utilities from Spotify (CRUNCH-484). Spotify also posted an interesting
blog post about how they currently use Crunch for analytics pipelines [1].

There are no board-level issues at this time.

Community
---------

Community activity has been similar, although slightly lower, in comparison
with recent quarters, with an average of several mails on the developer list
per day and an average of a message every two or three days on the user list.

Micah Whitacre was added to the PMC on April 3rd, 2014.

Last PMC added 9/2014 (Andriy Redko)

Community update:
With the release of the 3.0.x versions of CXF, there has been a steady stream
of questions and reports from users as they upgrade.  The community has done a
good job resolving issues and trying to push new versions out.   

CXF was represented at ApacheCon EU with 6 talks about CXF.

Security update:
2 new security advisories were made public at:
http://cxf.apache.org/security-advisories.html


-----------------------------------------
Attachment Q: Report from the Apache DB Project  [Myrna van Lunteren]

The Apache DB TLP consists of the following subprojects:
 o DdlUtils : a small, easy-to-use component for working with
                      Database Definition (DDL) files.
 o Derby     : an open source relational database implemented entirely in Java.
 o JDO        : focused on building the API and the TCK for compatibility
                      testing of Java Data Object implementations providing data
                      persistence.
 o Torque   : an object-relational mapper for Java.

== Status ==
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

Activities over the last quarter
a) The Derby community is adding features and fixes and working towards a
  10.12 release
b) Rick Hillegas of the Derby community created a 'Powered by Apache' Logo for
  Derby. The other sub-projects have not created such logos.
c) Activity review; the overall DB project is healthy and alive. Various
  projects do seem to show a slowing down compared to a few years ago:
  - an attempt a few years ago to move DdlUtils to the attic was called off by
    its user community, but not much further activity has ensued. 
  - Derby user-list activity is still lively, but activity on the developer
    list has recently appeared slower (e.g. 175 posts in Nov, vs. 524 posts in
    Nov last year).
  - Overall JDO postings have gone down, but development activity is ongoing. 
  - Torque list postings are down from a few years ago, but still show regular
    activity.

=== Community ===
No PMC changes since January 2014.
No new committers since August 2010.

Attachment R: Report from the Apache Deltacloud Project  [Marios S. Andreou]

Apache Deltacloud defines a web service API for interacting with cloud
service providers and resources in those clouds in a unified manner. In
addition, it consists of a number of implementations of this API for the
most popular clouds. It also provides an implementation of DMTF CIMI,

-- Overall activity in the past quarter --

There has been relatively little activity this quarter. The mailing list
continues to see some activity but it would appear the bulk of the PMC no
longer has the resources to dedicate the required attention (e.g. there
are still contributions pending approval - the latest in November 2014).

-- Last committers and PMC members elected --

Change of PMC chair 29 May 2013
(Marios S. Andreou takes over from David Lutterkort)

Tomas Sedovic (August 2012) and Dies Koper (December 2012) voted in as
committers.

Dies Koper was voted into the Deltacloud PMC in July 2013.

MapReduce, HBase, and Tez.


ISSUES
------
There are no issues that require board attention.


STATUS
------
Flink recently graduated in December from the Incubator. The infrastructure
for becoming a top-level project has been set up, the renaming of the mailing
lists is partially done (as of the time of writing this report).

The Apache press team announced the graduation on January 12th. There is a
decent media echo.


COMMUNITY
---------
* Last committer was voted in November 20th, 2014 (Timo Walther)

* When graduating to a TLP (December 17, 2014), all committers and
  a subset of the mentors formed the project Flink PMC

Attachment AB: Report from the Apache Incubator Project  [Roman Shaposhnik]

The Apache Incubator is the entry path into the ASF for projects and
codebases wishing to become part of the Foundation's efforts.

There are currently 36 podlings undergoing incubation.  One podling 
joined us this month (Corinthia). One member joined and two members
left the IPMC.

IPMC has recognized the need for tightening up mentorship requirements
and overall structure of the incubation process. Active discussions
on how to this in the best possible way are on going and the recommendation
is expected to be available in a few weeks.

--------------------
Brooklyn

Brooklyn is a framework for modelling, monitoring, and managing applications
through autonomic blueprints.

Brooklyn has been incubating since 2014-05-01.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Grow the community
  2. More diversity of the committers/PPMC (currently biased towards
     employees of a single organization)
  3. Following up our first release with further, regular, releases

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  None.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  Our community continues to grow slowly but surely, and has received
  interest and contributions from new community members.

  We had the opportunity to talk about our project at ApacheCon Europe
  recently, which has introduced Brooklyn to a wider audience within
  Apache.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  Code continues to be proposed and merged at a high rate. We are
  satisfied with our technical velocity.

  We recently completed our first release as an Apache project, and
  look forward to following this up with regular releases from now on.

Date of last release:

  2014-12-23 (apache-brooklyn-0.7.0-M2-incubating)

When were the last committers or PMC members elected?

  No change since 2014-07-02.

Shepherd/Mentor notes:

  Chip Childers (chipchilders):
  
    The Brooklyn community is doing very well in learning the rules /
    policies / nuances of working at the ASF. It still needs a bit more time
    to build up a diverse community IMO, but things are looking good.

  David Nalley (ke4qqq):
  
    The Brooklyn folks kicked out their first release during this reporting
    cycle, which is an important milestone. Work still remains in terms of
    building a diverse community.

--------------------
Calcite

Calcite is a highly customizable engine for parsing and planning queries on
data in a wide variety of formats. It allows database-like access, and in
particular a SQL interface and advanced query optimization, for data not
residing in a traditional database. (Renamed from Optiq on 2014-09-30.)

Calcite has been incubating since 2014-05-19.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Continue to build community
  2. Add more committers and PPMC members
  3. Demonstrate community robustness by rotating project tasks among
     multiple project members

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  None.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  In December, there were 84 messages on dev@, 45 commits, 50 issues
  created, 27 issues resolved by 7 contributors.

  Julian Hyde gave a talk "SQL on everything, in memory" about Calcite
  at the Strata + Hadoop World conference in October, and held an
  "office hour" with interested community members. He also spoke at
  a Hive meet-up in New York and a Kylin meet-up in San Jose about
  how those projects integrate with Calcite.

  Collaborations are under way with other Apache projects: with Drill
  to make implementation convention more neutral; with Hive for join
  algorithm selection, and leveraging sorted data; and with Phoenix
  to create a Calcite adapter for Phoenix.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  We have completed the rename from Optiq to Calcite. We have also
  re-organized the code into the org.apache.calcite namespace. We are
  planning to make a 1.0 release in January with the re-organized
  code.

Date of last release:

  2014-11-05 (0.9.2)

When were the last committers or PMC members elected?

  PPMC member elected in December (but has not yet accepted).

Corinthia

Corinthia is a toolkit/application for converting between and editing common
office file formats, with an initial focus on word processing. It is
designed to cater for multiple classes of platforms - desktop, web, and
mobile - and relies heavily on web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and
JavaScript for representing and manipulating documents. The toolkit is
small, portable, and flexible, with minimal dependencies. The target
audience is developers wishing to include office viewing, conversion, and
editing functionality into their applications.

Corinthia has been incubating since 2014-12-08.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  3. Grow the community

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  none

How has the community developed since the last report?

  This is our first podling report.

  We have spend a lot of mail on getting acquainted and finding the strength
  of each other.

  Now discussion are flowing freely. We have consensus on PPMC == Committer
  as long as we are in incubator.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  This is our first podling report.

  We are at work making a stable kernel so we can more easily add more
  developers.

   is always the hardest.  Good activity for a new podling on the lists,
   still waiting on the board report though.

--------------------
Ignite

A unified In-Memory Data Fabric providing high-performance, distributed in-
memory data management software layer between various data sources and user
applications.

Ignite has been incubating since 2014-10-01.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Finish migration to Apache process.
  2. Grow active and healthy community around Apache Ignite product.
  3. Get on a stable release schedule and have 3 successful product
     releases.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  None at the moment.

How has the community developed since the last report?

Shepherd/Mentor notes:

  Alan Cabrera (adc):

    This podling is off to a great start.  Mentors are extremely active
    participants with most of the non-Jira chatter being between Dmitriy
    Setrakyan and the mentors; look to the Jira issue to see the rest of the
    community "getting it done".  The "issues to be addressed" section seems
    reasonable.

  Branko Čibej (brane):

    I agree with Alan's assessment, but I'd really like to see more
    activity on the dev@ list; especially more of the initial committers
    getting involved in discussions there. Whilst Jira notifications are
    nice, I have a nagging feeling that most of the discussions within
    the community are happening off-line, which leaves a rather large
    hole in the community's collective memory (i.e., mail archives).
    This will have to be addressed before graduation.

--------------------

Kalumet

Kalumet a complete environment manager and deployer including J2EE
environments (application servers, applications, etc), softwares, and
resources.

Kalumet has been incubating since 2011-09-20.

Community Development:

  Apache Kalumet 0.6-incubating version has been released.  However, due to
  some misunderstanding, the release vote has not been completed by 3 IPMC.
  Especially, some legal files issues have been raised.
  
  We are preparing a 0.6.1-incubating release to fix the legal files and
  submit to IPMC vote.

  We are in the way of promoting the documentation on the website.

Project Development:

  We are preparing the 0.6.1-incubating (plan for December, 27) to fix the
  legal files issues raised on 0.6-incubating release and have a complete
  IPMC vote.

  We are preparing the 0.7-incubating release with the development changes.

  A new contributor has been identified and started to work on some issues
  and refactoring of the webconsole (mockup provided using Vaadin).

  Local branches have been created containing:
  
  - new model and REST API
  - new webconsole (remove of Echo framework)

  These local branches will be merged on the 0.7-incubating branch (master).

  Before Graduation:

  - The documentation has been updated and aligned with the 0.6-incubating
    release. The documentation will be promoted on the website and "linked"
    in announcement e-mails as soon as the 0.6.1-incubating release has been
    voted.
  - The 0.7-incubating release will fix the graduation issue, especially in
    term of license (removal of Echo2 framework for the UI).

  Post Graduation:

  - Kalumet scripts. It's the extension of the "software" concept globally
    to all Kalumet resources. It will allow users to create custom
    deployment/update plan, with a set of fine-grained steps.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware
of:

  None so far.

Kylin

Kylin is a distributed and scalable OLAP engine built on Hadoop to support
extremely large datasets.

Kylin has been incubating since 2014-11-25.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Migrate source code and issue tracking from github.com to Apache Git
     and JIRA
  2. Make the first release from apache
  3. Make project website available on apache

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  * Nothing

How has the community developed since the last report?

  The community is growing. Several new members have started actively
  contributing to the project. New contributors made a significant
  contribution in develop new feature, fix bugs, refine web experience.  The
  Kylin meetups at Bay Area and Beijing was well attended.  Apache Kylin has
  been presented at Big Data Technology Conference 2014, Beijing which is
  one of biggest Big Data conference in China.  Interest of people during
  that event was great and engaged a lots of organizations and individuals,
  many of them started to evaluate and joined Kylin community.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  1. The project setup is going quite well. Initial committers are
     onboarding, JIRA, mailing list were successfully done, Web content has
     been migrated to Apache Git but need tuning. Main source code migration
     will be done in January 2015.
  2. Bug fixing, enhancement are happing on current branch which
     will be the target v1.0 release.
  3. Work toward next gen version (supports inverted-index) is
     progressing substantially.

    required for graduation.

--------------------
MRQL

MRQL is a query processing and optimization system for large-scale,
distributed data analysis, built on top of Apache Hadoop, Hama, Spark, and
Flink.

MRQL has been incubating since 2013-03-13.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Increase the number of active committers
  2. Increase adoption, expand user community, and increase user list
     activity

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  The project is not making much progress on the level of increasing the
  number of active committers and expanding the users community.

  This is already being discussed inside the project community and the main
  active committer asked to give the project more few months as he will try
  spreading the word more about the project through some public events

How has the community developed since the last report?

  None

How has the project developed since the last report?

  During the last three month, 12 jira issues were reported, from which 10
  were fixed. Most of these issues were related to MRQL query evaluation in
  Flink mode. Finally, we have set up MRQL on ASF Jenkins, which is a CI
  server that continuously checks the integrity of our builds and validates
  our tests.

--------------------
NiFi

NiFi is a dataflow system based on the concepts of flow-based programming.

NiFi has been incubating since 2014-11-24.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Produce an initial release.
  2. Grow our community beyond the initial set of committers.
  3. Establish rhythm for releases, review processes, and document how to
     most effectively bring on new committers.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  Nothing we wish to raise at this time.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  The dev mailing list has picked up 20 new e-mails since the last report
  and is now at 62 (commits has grown to 25).

  At the suggestion of the community we've adopted a review-then-commit
  strategy which is designed to among other things help with community
  development.

  We've received several patches from members outside the initial committer
  list including changes which dramatically improved our build process and
  provide new extensions.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  All of our current infrastructure needs are setup and things are working
  really well.  Our focus now is on working towards our first release which
  is 0.0.1 and presently comprised of 85 JIRA issues the vast majority of
  which are resolved.  We've conducted a thorough review of all source files
  to ensure proper license headers/notices/disclaimers are present.  We've
  completed a thorough review and modification of the overall LICENSE and
  NOTICE files in preparation for release.  We've conducted the initial
  podling name search and submitted the ticket for that analysis to be
  verified and confirmed.

Date of last release:

  N/A

When were the last committers or PMC members elected?

  We have not grown the official committer list beyond the initial committer
  list.  Though there are a couple of folks who are committing fairly
  consistently now and a new member to join the dev mailing list that is
  very promising.

--------------------
NPanday

NPanday allows projects using the .NET framework to be built with Apache
Maven.

NPanday has been incubating since 2010-08-13.

Shepherd/Mentor notes:

  P. Taylor Goetz (ptgoetz):

    NPanday has missed the last two reports (last report August 2014). One
    of two mentors are engaged and encouraging the podling to make a final
    release before retiring (last release was on 2011-05-17). However, there
    is little PPMC/Committer involvement with only 2 PPMC members showing
    involvement on the dev@ list in the past year. Also confirmed that a
    report reminder email was received by the dev@ list for each of the last
    missed reporting periods as well at the current period.

    It's clear that mentors past and present have attempted to help the
    NPanday project grow to a viable size -- at least enough to approve a
    release, new Committer/PPMC Member, or even decide to retire -- without
    success.

    The main warning signs appear to be:

    * Inability to reach community consensus (barely 2 acive Committer/PPMC
      Members, making 3 +1s for any vote very difficult)
    * Inability to perform releases
    * Inability to grow the community to a viable size

    The issues listed above do not indicate a lack of mentor involvement,
    but rather a community in decline.

--------------------
ODF Toolkit

Java modules that allow programmatic creation, scanning and manipulation of
OpenDocument Format (ISO/IEC 26300 == ODF) documents

ODF Toolkit has been incubating since 2011-08-01.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Grow the community in terms of committers
  2. Have regular releases
  3. Decide if we would like to be a top level project or join an existing
     project, or move to the attic.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  No new.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  We have made a release but there has been little activity since then.
  
  We still need to attract more members and publicizing the project in the
  ODF.

It seems like the project is active in release and code (towards the low
activity side).  However the mailing list traffic and engagement has decreased
overtime and the dev list even with jira notifications is still very low
traffic.

Attachment AC: Report from the Apache Isis Project  [Dan Haywood]

Apache Isis is a framework to enable the creation of software using
domain-driven design principles, being an implementation of the naked
objects architectural pattern


== Activity ==

Mailing list activity has been steady; user mailing list subscriptions 
are unchanged (some turnover) but the number of mailing list messages is 
increasing with some good contributions from the user community.

We have also started to get more code contributions from the community, one of 
which has been quite substantial.

In the last report we described how we are have created a new "Isis Addons"
website [1] and have moved some components out of the framework's codebase.  To
clarify the relationship, these are external to the framework for several
reasons:
* they tend to be code that either runs on top of Isis (reusable domain logic
  entities) or implementations of optional hooks that Isis exposes (services
  such as auditing, security).
* as such, they have a different cadence to the framework "proper"
* we wanted less formality, leveraging github collaboration capabilities
* also, to allow for contributions that would not be compliant with ASF 
  license restrictions, eg if dependent on LGPL.
* (as noted previously) to reduce the size of the Isis codebase so that it
  can be more clearly focussed on its core responsibilities.
  
== Development and Releases ==

Isis rate of development has increased this quarter.  As noted in the previous
report,  Eurocommercial Properties NV are sponsoring the development of Isis
for two Isis committers, Martin Grigorov (also a Wicket committer), and myself.

In addition, there is another small client that is now sponsoring our time to
implement some additional capabilities of the framework.  This client was
introduced to us by Oscar Bou, another Isis committer.

This quarter we made one new release, v1.7.0 on 18 Oct 2014 [2].


== Committers and PMC ==

There has been one new committer added and change to the PMC this quarter
* last committer added: Martin Grigorov, 4 Dec 2014 [3]
* last PMC change: Martin Grigorov, 13 Dec 2014


== Issues ==

There are no outstanding issues requiring board attention.

OVERALL ACTIVITY

Some code has been committed on the mime4j module related to refactoring
and patch submission by user.

The mailing list activity and patch submission for the server component
has been mainly generated by the users.

Activity on server code commits remains too low. The discussion at PMC level
on this point has not yet been started.

We received on 16. October 2014 a vulnerability report followed by a mail from
CERT to track the open VU#988628. We will now handle this in an urgent way.

COMMUNITY

No new committer (Last committer was voted on 30 of Nov 2013).

No new PMC member (Last PMC member was voted on 17 Jul 2012).

--------------
jclouds has carried out one successful release (1.8.1) in the last quarter and
is currently discussing the planning of the next major (1.9.0) release.

The developer and user community remains active, with a welcome increase in
involvement by new contributors. The PMC is trying to streamline the project
structure and process for contributions in order to make best possible use of 
limited core team time and in order to encourage continued interest and
involvement from cloud developers.

Last PMC member: 2014-11-30 (Chris Custine)

As resolved at the October 2014 board meeting, the PMC chair is currently
Andrew Phillips.

The jclouds PMC would like to express its sincere thanks to Adrian Cole, who
recently left the PMC, for his years of work in building jclouds and growing
the jclouds community.

Community Objectives
--------------------
What are the projects main plans and expectations for the community in the
next period?

* Establish consensus on the core purpose and functionality of the project
moving forward and focus on ensuring this continues to be delivered
* Establish clear guidance on the expectations around new contributions
(technical and in terms of the type of contributions likely to be accepted)
* Provide example code demonstrating current best coding and design practices
* Create a more predictable "graduation path" for new contributions
* Reduce overhead of the project setup to simplify releases and maintenance of
core functionality

Apache Maven is a widely-used project build tool, targeting mainly Java 
development. Apache Maven promotes the use of dependencies via a 
standardized coordinate system, binary plugins, and a standard build 
lifecycle.

* General Information

  * Work on plugin releases to define common 2.2.1 minimum Maven version
    and Java 5 requirements continues: we created an automated report [1]
    that shows 33 plugins are ready from 49. Once finished, we expect to
    start 3.x line of plugins with Maven 3 and Java 6 minimum requirements.

  * There was a contest to create a new Maven logo and create a mascot: 
    the winning logo is [2] and the winning mascot (officially christened) 
    "The Maven Owl" [3]. Work is now in progress to integrate it to the Maven
    site.

  * We're studying Jira migration from Codehaus to Apache for better end-users
    consistency, since we've got feedback about users lost when requiring to
    create a Jira account at Codehaus.

  * Compliance with ASF source header policy

    We enabled rat check on every build in maven-parent POM 25 to ensure full
    compliance from now on.
    Issue closed: this report is the last one with status on this topic.

Attachment AT: Report from the Apache Onami Project  [Nino Martinez Wael]

DESCRIPTION

Apache Onami is a project focused on the development and maintenance
of a set of Google Guice extensions not provided out of the box by the
library itself nor the Google developers team, such as integration
with 3rd part frameworks or extra functionalities.

MILESTONES

Onami-Persist 1.0.1 has been released

CURRENT ACTIVITY

PMC are discussing how to manage releases using GIT. And has now setup a trial
GIT repo on github (just to experiment with for the release process).

Christian Grobmeier (grobmeier) has resigned from PMC but remains a committer.

COMMUNITY

Currently the project are migrating from SVN to GIT.

Users community is quite silent.

ISSUES

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

Attachment AV: Report from the Apache OpenMeetings Project  [Sebastian Wagner]

Attachment AW: Report from the Apache OpenOffice Project  [Andrea Pescetti]

Apache OpenOffice is an open-source, office-document productivity
suite providing six productivity applications based around the
OpenDocument Format (ODF). OpenOffice is released on multiple
platforms and in dozens of languages.

### Issues for Board Awareness
1) Andrea Pescetti, the current PMC Chair, gave his availability
to resign as soon as a successor can be elected: after 2 years it's
time for a rotation. Discussions are still ongoing, so the
resolution won't arrive in time for the January Board meeting.

2) The Apache OpenOffice community is still struggling in
involving new volunteers who can independently work on big
developments. Lack of appropriate mentors is still the main issue.

3) Following the many discussions we had in 2014, OpenOffice now
needs a replacement for Apache Extras. SourceForge provided a
proof of concept that could work for us, but we prefer that the new
location for Apache Extras is decided at an ASF-wide level (i.e.,
that, as it used to be the case, all Apache projects put their
"Extras" in a common space).

### Community Development/Outreach Progress
Since the last report, the project added two PMC members:
Michael and Mechtilde Stehmann (mikeadvo, mechtilde) in
December 2014. The latest committer addition is from May 2014 (tal).

We continue to see new volunteers who would like to be involved,
but we are able to use them for relatively easy tasks only, since we
are still witnessing a reduced level of activity (in terms of both
contributed lines of code and e-mails to the dev list) from more
experienced developers.

The OpenOffice custom infrastructure (wiki, forum) is now out of the
"minimal maintenance" mode and is assigned to Jan Iversen.

A new documentation effort for an end-users manual under the ALv2
licence is stalled, even though new volunteers show up regularly.
The problem is still the lack of appropriate coordinators/mentors.

The localization community is growing, with new volunteers and new
languages.

A survey run just before ApacheCon EU showed that we have a lot
on unexpressed potential in our volunteers, especially for
non-development tasks. The challenge is now to implement the "better
tools" and "better guidance" that these volunteers asked for, in
several fields, from documentation to marketing to QA.

OpenOffice had a dedicated track at ApacheCon Budapest, with
talks spanning all the main project areas except core development.
OpenOffice will have a dedicated booth and a devroom (shared
with other OpenDocument Editors) at FOSDEM 2015, 31 January in
Brussels.

The mailing lists for user support, localization, development are
quite active, the marketing, documentation, QA lists are moderately
active. Activity in social media is still good. Community support
forums remain popular with users, with an average of over 100 posts
per day.

### Product/Project Development Progress
Apache OpenOffice 4.1.2 is currently in the plans. It will be a
bugfix release, but it will contain a major new feature in terms of
packaging, with digitally signed installers and executables that
will be accepted by modern Windows systems without warnings.
Considering the many counterfeited sites offering variants of
OpenOffice and the number of our users, this will be a significant
milestone for the project.

Activities that are still foreseen, but mostly stalled at the
moment, include: actions for an easier installation and availability
on mainstream Linux distributions; a new localization process, now
progressing in the l10n40 branch; a rewritten OOXML filter,
allowing import and (later) export.

The download trend remains very strong: Apache OpenOffice passed the
130 million downloads at the end of 2014.

Attachment AX: Report from the Apache PDFBox Project  [Andreas Lehmkühler]

The Apache PDFBox library is an open source Java tool for working with PDF
documents.

General Comments
----------------

There are no issues that require Board attention.


Community
---------

There is a steady stream of contributions and bug reports from the community.

John Hewson and Tilman Hausherr were added as committers and PMC members to
our ranks in February 2014.

493 (481 last report) subscribers on the user@ list 
149 (155 last report) subscribers on the dev@ list

170 JIRA tickets were created and 233 were resolved in the past 3 months.

Releases
--------

Version 1.8.8 was released on 13nd of December 2014. It is an incremental
bugfix release based on PDFBox 1.8.x.

Development:
------------

The work on our next major release is an ongoing effort. The main topics are:

- switch to java 1.6
- enhance the parser
- code cleanup
- enhance rendering
- enhance font handling
- add unicode support
- reduce memory footprint

The long-awaited new major release is still under construction and there is
still a lot to do. Most of the bigger parts are done so that we see the light
at the end of the tunnel.

Software Quality
----------------

There is an ongoing effort to improve PDFBox based on the analysis of
different tools such as SonarQube, FindBugs and others. Only last month we
reduced the number of issues as reported SonarQube by 20%.

We joined our forces with the Tika project. Tim Allison ran some tests on
their huge pool of test files pdfs (> 50.000 pdfs) to
- avoid regressions when preparing the PDFBox 1.8.8 bugfix release
- get clearance for updating Tika to use PDFBox 1.8.8
- find differences/areas for improvements comparing the new major release 2.0 
to the current released version 1.8.x
- avoid regressions when switching the parser
- find areas for improvements/unsupported features and corner case pdfs not
exactly following the pdf specs

Attachment BC: Report from the Apache Struts Project  [Rene Gielen]

The Apache Struts MVC framework is a solution stack for creating elegant
and modern action-based Java web applications. It favors convention over
configuration, is extensible using a plugin architecture, and ships with
plugins to support technologies such as REST, AJAX and JSON.

The Struts team made one release in the last quarter:
* Struts 2.3.21 - feature, bug fix and security fix release (2014-12-08)

The last quarter was dominated by stabilizing and releasing Struts
2.3.20, which is a major feature and bug fix release with more than 140
issues addressed. It also addresses a security issue known as
CVE-2014-7809 / JVN#88408929 [1]

We have made no progress in releasing a security fix version of the
already EOLed Struts 1 framework. However, a workaround now exists which
was developed and is provisioned externally. [2]

In the last quarter we released a fully reworked web site, including a
brand new Struts logo [1]. The design was kindly provided by
SoftwareMill, a polish software development shop our fellow PMC member
Łukasz Lenart is working for.

Within the reporting period we saw a significant rise in discussion and
planning efforts regarding a major new framework development line to be
released as Struts 3.

No new committers or PMC members have been added in the last quarter.
Last PMC member addition was on 2013-05-11, last committer addition on
2014-01-06.

We have no issues that require board assistance at this time.

=========================
The last release (1.7) was made in January 2015[1], with many new features
including an OCR Parser based on Tesseract, improvements to the Tika JAXRS
Server and a number of parser fixes & enhancements.

Discussions have now started on the dev@ list to outline a roadmap[2] for what
a new 2.X stream could look like for the evolution of Tika.

Community

Attachment BI: Report from the Apache Tiles Project  [Greg Reddin]

Apache Tiles is a free open-sourced templating framework for modern Java
applications. Based upon the Composite pattern it is built to simplify
the development of user interfaces.

This report is almost a carbon copy of the last one. There have been a couple of
releases and some discussion of progress, but no real change in the pace of the
project. I am submitting with this report a resolution to change the project
chair. I am finding that I have less and less time to fulfill the duties and
I don't want the project to suffer from my lack of time. I intend to remain on
the PMC and provide help to the new chair and oversight of releases, etc.

The Tiles project continues to move at a slow pace, but work is ongoing.
In the last quarter the project has produced two releases:

 * Tiles Request 1.0.6 GA
 * Tiles 3.0.5 GA

The community to Tiles remains the same, a largely stable project.
The same one or two people have been continuing to do much of the
development for Tiles. There remains a little traffic in the users list
and in the issue tracker and these are responded to and/or fixed usually
within the week. The Spring community, and stackexchange.com, reamain the
most active inputs to the community.

Apache Traffic Server is an HTTP proxy server and cache, similar to Squid
and Varnish in functionality and features.

Issues
======

There are no issues that needs the board's attention.


Community
=========

One new committer was added since last report, leaving us with a total of 40
committers.  Our last committer and PMC member was added on 12/16/2014.
Activity on mailing list is normal, growth in subscriber list is almost
identical to the previous quarter:

    users@ - 457 subscribers (up 3% since last report)
    dev@ - 298 subscribers (up 3% since last report)

In Jira, 168 new tickets were opened and 258 were resolved or closed since
the last board report, which had 202 and 103 respectively. 786 changes were
committed to our git repository from 31 contributors. Last report had 624
commits from 44 contributors.


Events
======

The Fall 2014 ATS Summit was held at LinkedIn's offices in Sunnyvale. It was
well received, with participants from committers, developers and users. Slides
from most of the topics are available at

     https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/TS/Presentations+-+2014

A Bug Scrub event was held in the Chicago area, going through a large number
of issues.

We are planning for our next Summit event adjacent to the 2015 ApacheCon
NA. In addition to that, we plan on holding "Hackathon" sessions before,
during and after the conference.


Releases
========

Three new releases were made since last report:

    Apache Traffic Server v5.2.0 (released 1/14/2015)
    Apache Traffic Server v5.1.2 (released 12/16/2014)
    Apache Traffic Server v5.1.1 (released 10/31/2014)

The v4.2.x version will be supported until Q3 2015, this is extended by an
additional 6 month from the initial plan. We have decided to avoid making
releases during the holidays around Thanksgiving and in December, and adjusted
our release schedules accordingly. The 5.2.0 release was delayed for a full
month as well. Learning from this, we expect release schedules to be further
adjusted in the 2015-2016 plans.

Planned releases include:

   * 5.3.0: April 2015
   * 6.0.0: July 2015

Attachment BM: Report from the Apache Tuscany Project  [Jean-Sebastien Delfino]

Apache Tuscany is an SOA framework based on OASIS OpenCSA and SCA.

ISSUES
- Community activity is very low.

RELEASES
- Last release was Tuscany SCA 2.0.1, 10/3/2013.

COMMUNITY ACTIVITY
- Last committer addition was Sebastian Millies, 12/4/2012.

- Mailing list traffic is low with 18 messages on the user list and 12
messages on the dev list in 2014, and one JIRA notification on the dev list
in 2015.

- There were no commits from the Tuscany committers in 2014, only one commit
from Infra adding the Web site to SVN for svnpubsub. There was one commit from
a Tuscany committer in 2015 adding a DOAP file to the project.

- A discussion thread was started on Aug 16 on both user and dev lists to
request community input on new development plans. One response from a PMC
member suggesting a new release to pick up updated dependencies.

- The PMC chair indicated on Aug 21 on the private list his intention to step
out of the PMC and asked for volunteers to replace him as he is too busy with
other work. Given the absence of response from any other PMC members, he is
continuing for now with the little spare time he has left.

- Another discussion thread was started on Sep 17 on the private list asking
if there were enough PMC members to get the project going. Three responses,
one too busy to continue, another still following the mailing list without
seeing a realistic prospect to get involved in a release or commit activity,
a third stating that we need enough PMC members willing to review and vote on
releases or new committers/PMCs but volunteering to do that.

BRANDING
- The project needs to update logos with ™.

Attachment BN: Report from the Apache VXQuery Project  [Till Westmann]

Apache VXQuery implements a parallel XML Query processor.

ISSUES

There are no issues that require the board's attention at this time.

STATUS

Apache VXQuery graduated from the incubator in July 2014. Feature development in
the last 3 month was slow. Most work went into the paper on performance
evaluation (and comparison with other systems).

COMMUNITY

All PMC members came in through graduation, all committers are PMC members.
The community is still small. Last committer (Steven Jacobs) was added in
September 2013.

COMMUNITY OBJECTIVES

- Continued focus on completing the engine and on growing the community. The
  paper that will hopefully increase the visibility of the project should be 
  finished in January.
- Focus on bringing off-list communication back to the mailing list (a number
  of discussions happened off-list and were not brought back).

RELEASES

Apache VXQuery 0.4 was released on Sep 7, 2014

Apache Whirr is a library for running services like Hadoop or ZooKeeper in the
cloud.

Releases:
No new releases this quarter. Last release was 0.8.2, April 2013.

Community:
The PMC composition did not change, and we had no new committers since
the last report. The last PMC change was the addition of Andrew Bayer
in November of 2012, and the last new committer was Graham Gear, also
in November of 2012.

Issues:
No news - we need to start the process of going to the Attic.

Attachment BQ: Report from the Apache Wink Project  [Luciano Resende]

Apache Wink is a project that enables development and consumption of
REST style web services. The core server runtime is based on the
JAX-RS (JSR 311) standard. The project also introduces a client
runtime which can leverage certain components of the server-side
runtime. Apache Wink delivers component technology that can be easily
integrated into a variety of environments.

There are no issues that require Board attention at the moment.

Community:
The Wink project has a small community which is not very active. We have
had discussions on how to increase community activity, but no concrete
activity has actually been executed. Having said that, I believe Wink is 
a mature project with active users and we should not consider any retirement
actions at the moment. 
Last svn activity shows couple patches being applied towards wink website 
in August, but actually no code change since december 2013.
Mailing lists are also slow as usual in the past year.

Releases:
* Last release was Apache Wink 1.4.0 which was released on September 15, 2013

Committers or PMC changes:
* Voted Gerhard Petracek was added as a Wink committer in August 2013.

Trademark/Branding:
* No known issues.

Legal Issues:
* None
