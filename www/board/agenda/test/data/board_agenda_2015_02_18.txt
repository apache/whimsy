 4. Executive Officer Reports

    A. Chairman [Brett]

       I've started to pull together the resources for the Annual meeting in
       late March (after the next and final meeting of the current board).
       I plan to set the record date and send out formal notices in the
       next week.

       I hope to encourage people unable to attend the meeting to submit
       non-voting proxies well in advance of the meeting, and will see what
       we can do to make that process easier. I also expect to perform the
       Omnibus resolution using the voter tool again, so that we do not need
       to pass any resolutions during the meeting itself.

    B. President [Ross]

       Branding: Shane has requested that Mark Radcliffe join the board meeting
       during the discussion items to help us understand the role of trademarks
       within the ASF. He will join at 11AM PT. I hope that we can make time for
       this.

       EA: Usual support work. Shane has requested that our EA help more with
       branding items. This is something we have been offering for a long
       time. We are working on identifying concrete ways in which we can
       empower Melissa to take action. I intend to move Melissa too a PEO
       organization (Virtual) assuming no surprises in the cost of doing so or
       objections from Melissa (we do not expect it to increase ASF costs
       significantly, if at al). This may be a temporary measure but as
       previously reported we need to take action and this point a PEO is the
       only viable option. See the vice Chairman report for more detail.

       Branding: VP Brand Management expresses concern about management of our
       brands in projects where the brand is highly valuable. Our policies
       appear to be working to date. Delegating to the PMCs has spread the
       workload sufficiently that increased vigilance on complex cases is not
       posing a significant problem.  However, Shane warns that the recent
       interest in external related foundations will only serve to increase
       the brand management workload. shane has invites Mark Radcliff of
       DLAPiper to speak to the board today, though this is not related to the
       concerns raised. The discussion item is the importance of brand
       management tot he ASF in preparation for budget planning.

       Fundraising: We continue to iron out wrinkles in the Fundraising
       process. Each month it seems to be running more smoothly. Processes are
       sufficiently well defined for Hadrian to participate in the exploration
       of a CRM for managing sponsor relations (something Melissa had
       previously been driving in her own time), No decision has been made at
       this point.

       Marketing and Publicity: Sally produced our first quarterly report.
       This is a good start though not quite what I had envisioned. We will
       continue to work on and improve this in the coming quarters. Sally
       helped with the CRM discussions and provided feedback to Hadrian. It is
       not felt that VP Marketing requires a CRM, however, if possible I would
       like to see us doing a better job of capturing knowledge from this
       office. That being said, fundraising support remains the priority.
       Sally has revisited the home page (not site) redesign discussions based
       on extensive feedback from the membership.

       Infrastructure: An excellent, productive month for Infra - well done
       team!  Hardware budget is expected to be reduced thanks to a
       combination of credit with multiple cloud providers. My thanks go to VP
       Infra for making this happen. Whimsy was identified as a critical
       service that infra need to manage.  This resulted in some discussion
       about how best to manage the service. Sam Ruby has been working with
       the infra team on this topic. There has been excellent progress on
       automating machine builds and retiring old machines. In the case of
       LDAP this introduced a few problems which are being addressed in order
       of priority. We had some initial discussion about the CMS used by many
       Apache projects. This system is very much hacked together and is
       largely unmaintainable without significant expense. No decisions has
       been made on how to proced, future reports will update. Some project
       specific services  (Maven and Cassandra) are progressing nicely. 

       No report from Travel Assistance. Plans for ApacheCon NA are in progress. 
       <private>
       whisper, whisper, whisper
       </private>

       Budget:; Budget planning is a little behind schedule but I do have
       complete numbers from Virtual now. We are progressing with one office
       having submitted their budget numbers already. Expect an early draft
       within the week.

       Additionally, please see Attachments 1 through 6.

    C. Treasurer [Chris]

        The 2013 990 Net Assets and other items have been clarified on our
        tax preparation for FY2013. Everything seems in order and Chris and
        Tom had a call to discuss on 1/23/15.
        
        The Treasurer’s Office initiated a series of wires to fully transfer
        all of the remaining funds in WFS to Citizen’s Bank leaving a small
        amount in WFS (less than 10K) to cover any incoming expenses. We
        expect to finalize the remaining funds transfer and decommission
        WFS in the next month.
        
        1099s for contractors have been issued by Virtual.
        
        Virtual has been working with VP, Press and Marketing for the year
        in review reports and quarterly reports, providing financial data
        and other information to assist in the report preparation.

    D. Secretary [Craig]

       Secretary continues to operate smoothly. In January, 65 iclas, three cclas,
       and five grants were received and filed.

    E. Executive Vice President [Rich]

       I will be late to the meeting by about 30 minutes. I will be there to answer
       questions, if any, by the end of the meeting.

       I am scrambling to get the schedule for ApacheCon NA put together, and while
       I've received a LOT of help from various people, the current CFP tools are
       woefully inadequate for the task. However, we should have a schedule, and
       keynotes, announced early next week.

       Meanwhile, I have delegated most of the work for ApacheCon EU to Jan Iversen,
       so that I'm not trying to do manage two events, and I am looking around for
       someone that might be interested in stepping up to rotate ApacheCon NA events
       with me.

    F. Vice Chairman [Greg]
    
       Apologies for the short report, yet upon substative matter:
       after speaking with Ross (President) and David (VP Infra), we
       have decided to move one contractor to an employee status via
       the PEO framework provided by Virtual as an experiment for the
       next two months. At the May Board meeting, a complete solution
       for all US-based contractors will be provided for Board review
       and consideration.
       
       Background: there are two options remaining open: PEO-based
       employment, and a third-party whole-option contract. Moving one
       contractor to the PEO solution will provide us needed detail.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment 2: Report from the VP of Brand Management  [Shane Curcuru]

Worked on clearing podling name search entries; however not all PPMCs are
performing the needed steps before submitting.

Submitted two educational talks on branding plus a potential barcamp/PMC
tutorial at ApacheCon Austin.

Denied a services branding request using a derivative of a registered Apache
mark that would highly likely be infringing if used. While it is positive this
third party requested permission first, it is puzzling why they would request
permissions for something so clearly inappropriate.

Requested branding updates related to improper use of our HADOOP mark on the
new opendataplatform.org website.  As many popular Apache projects grow in
widespread use and broad commercial interest, it will become more important
than ever to ensure that our PMCs understand the importance of their
trademarks in managing an independent project, and ensuring that they have the
tools - education, access to counsel when needed, and the ability to register
their marks - to do so.

As a new website, the specific legal trademark issues on opendataplatform.org
are limited (so far) and it's not clear how the relevant companies will
present branding going forward.  However third party projects like this that
blur the lines between their software product offerings and the underlying
Apache software products are likely to cause other issues about end user
confusion as to the true source of software, as well as concern with many
developers who may be interested in contributing to Apache projects.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 3: Report from the VP of Fundraising  [Jim Jagielski]

Fundraising continues steadily. There are a number of sponsors who indicated
that will renew, but are late to respond. I hope that more communication will
improve things in time.  We did receive payments from Bloomberg, Hortonworks,
Winwork, and Samsung.

We are putting more effort in deciding on the CRM tool to manage the process.
Hadrian got actively involved had a couple of chats with HotWax Media. It is
very hard to find a solution that will make everybody happy. Hadrian did
research open source alternatives and is now researching commercial, hosted
alternatives. Hadrian is close to making a formal proposal, very likely using
a hosted solution. The proposal and hopefully a decision should be done before
the next board meeting.

We made a recommendation to update the Thanks page and Daniel Gruno provided a
concrete layout proposal. The proposal was accepted and Hadrian is working
with Daniel to update the Thanks page.

Hadrian had a couple of phone calls with sponsors. The goal is to improve the
dialogue with the sponsors and find out what sponsors see as valuable and
expect from the foundation.  We anticipate this to lead to ideas and proposals
for improvements, discuss on the fundraising@ lists and report back to the
board.

Cloudera upgraded its sponsorship to Platinum level. Yay, thanks Cloudera!

Attachment 4: Report from the VP of Marketing and Publicity  [Sally Khudairi]

I. Budget: Sally Khudairi has been working with Tom Pappas of Virtual on the
Marketing & Publicity FY2014 budget expenditures to date, as well as to
prepare for the submission to ASF President Ross Gardler for the upcoming
fiscal year. There were some items totaling $8,511.02 that were erroneously
charged against the budget and were re-allocated to the TAC and Conferences
budgets accordingly.

II. Fundraising/Branding/Marketing liaison: Sally continues to liaise with
Trademarks & Brand Management with usage requests where needed. She continues
to work with Hadrian Zbarcea on items relating to the transition of the new

Attachment 5: Report from the VP of Infrastructure  [David Nalley]

New Karma:
==========
none

Finances:
==========
17.49  - Domain name renewals
979.12 - Amazon Web Services

As a side note, we expect to spend dramatically less on hardwware than
we originally budgeted. This difference is coming about due to a number
of issues: Our build farm has been dramatically subsidized thanks to
Yahoo who have provided ~30 physical machines (a long with hosting the
hardware and providing smarthands support). We also now have multiple
cloud providers giving us extensive credits, and we are moving a number
of services to public cloud providers. This does mean a slight change
from capital expenses to operational expenses, though I don't think that
from our perspective that it matters much. 

Operations Action Items:
========================
n/a

Short Term Priorities:
======================

Codesigning
-----------
Tomcat generated two signing events this month, both for Tomcat 8.0.18

Machine deprecation
-------------------
We've made significant progress in moving services off of some of our oldest hosts.
In doing so we've also have spent a good chunk of time automating these
services and making our deployment more robust. See more on this issue
in the section on Automation in Long Range Priorities. 

Backups
-------
We are just now beginning the deployment of a new centralized backup service. 
The client installation as well as the server has been autoamted, expect
to see more in this space in the coming months. 

LDAP
----
The LDAP service has largely been rebuilt from the ground up. For
background, the old machine that formerly served as our svn master was
also one of our LDAP machines, and when it failed, we were down to one
very poorly performing instance in the US. Subsequently, we've rebuilt
the entire service using configuration management, we again have two
LDAP hosts in OSUOSL, that are easily handling the load. This has sped
up many of the authn/authz actions that were slow last month. We've also
deployed new LDAP instances to several of our cloud zones. While the
services seems to be working well at this point, we did have a few
hiccups, where the old LDAP servers were removing newly created
accounts. The older LDAP servers were left in place after we repeatedly
found a number of services that had either minotaur or harmonia
hardcoded as LDAP servers. Because of these problems we removed the
legacy instances, and are dealing with the problems caused as we find
them. 

Bugzilla
--------
Our three Bugzilla instances were still running on a 6 year old machine
but have since been successfully puppetized and migrated to VMs in one of
our cloud accounts. In the process we've worked fastidiously on improving
the software deployment mechanism (software is now deployed as an
OS-native package). 

Long Range Priorities:
======================

Automation
----------
Significant progress to report this month. As indicated above, LDAP
machines are all under configuration management. Additionally, we migrated
all three of the Bugzilla instances and the git repositories to being
completely managed by configuration management. After finding some
problems with some of our CM-managed instances, we've adopted a process of
destroying and recreating a service as a verification step prior to
pressing a service into production status. 
Naturally the new services we are bringing online, like the backup service
are all managed under CM. 

Technical Debt
--------------
The move of LDAP has uncovered a lot of hardcoded values and we've been
working to pay that off. (referring to service names rather than
specific machine identities, putting configuration in configuration
management where possible. 

General Activity:
=================

Bintray
-------
As of January 30th, we enabled Cassandra's debian repository on bintray
and have been monitoring it closely. The service seems to be working
well and appears to have fulfilled the needs of reducing our overall
webserver traffic and has the bonus of giving more insight into the
downloads. You can see some of the statistics on the dashboard here:
https://s.apache.org/bintray1
https://s.apache.org/bintray2

Maven
-----

A lot has been happening around Maven this period. 
We've successfully been able to sync a copy of the Maven central
repository, and are working to provide access to that store for the Maven
PMC. 
Additionally, Mark Thomas along with folks from the Maven PMC have been
working on migrating the Maven contents of the Codehaus Jira instance to
the ASF instance. Good progress has been made here, but much remains to be
done.  


Uptime Statistics:
==================

We experienced an issue where status.apache.org was reporting erroneous uptime
statistics due to two unused LDAP checks, which unfortunately made it into the
weekly ASF blog posts. Other than that, services have been running fairly
smoothly aside from the Moin Moin Wiki which has experienced high load times
for a couple of weeks. We are discussing what to do to remedy this. Overall,
the total uptime for this year grew by 0.03%:


Type:                Target:   Reality, total:  Reality, month:  Target Met:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Critical services:   99.50%             99.78%           99.82%      Yes
Core services:       99.00%             99.83%           99.92%      Yes
Standard services:   95.00%             99.02%           98.93%      Yes
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Overall:             98.59%             99.60%           99.63%      Yes

Tony Stevenson: 
  - A lot of my time has been spent on 3 major tasks: 
    - The rebuild of the LDAP service due to the poorly performing incumbent
      instances. This combined with the retirement of eris (old svn-master) 
      following a terminal hardware fault, we were limited to 1 LDAP instance
      in the US and proved too much for minotaur to cope with. It appears that
      the version of slapd on FreeBSD on minotaur leaked memory at a phenomenal
      rate.  The new LDAP service has been moved to the latest slapd available
      in Ubuntu 14.04, it has been fully built using puppet, and configured so
      that new LDAP hosts can be added with ease.
    - Continue preparation and understanding for a rebuild the email
      infrastructure. This has mostly taken a back seat but has been brought up
      to the top of my todo list now following the completion of the LDAP task
      above, and the CMS task below.
    - In line with our current policy of retiring hardware that is over 4 years
      old, and trying to make all services pupept managed; David asked me to
      review the CMS zone on baldr (which is now >7 years old) to ensure we can
      move the service and have it managed with puppet. However upon
      investigation it quickly became apparent moving the service was far from
      trivial given the requirement for ZFS alone.  Further reading of the code
      highlighted some areas of concern for me that I felt needed highlighting
      as they would likely carry over technical debt into the future and that
      is something we are working extremely hard to remove.  On the back of
      these findings and my inherited knowledge of the service I presented
      David with 3 options of how I thought we could manage the service going
      forward along with the estimated costs, and the pro's and con's of each
      option. There were: 
      1 - Move CMS to another FreeBSD host - undesirable given our current
          trajectory of moving away from FreeBSD, it meant entirely replicating
          the FreeBSD 9 jail too. This was the path of least change, but 
          perhaps most difficult.
      2 - Move the service to Ubuntu and fully puppet controlled the beginning.
          This might have been the ideal scenario, but the underlying hardcoded
          FreeBSD aspects, the need for ZFS (which is present in Ubuntu), and 
          the very specific perl that is in place I felt this would take a long
          time to complete and would be significantly error prone. We would 
          very likely miss something and this would need to fixed on demand. My
          confidence level was low that we could execute a clean migration. 
          This would be the most time consuming option, but if retention of the
          CMS was important the best option.
      3 - Deprecate the CMS, and allow projects to determine their own
          publishing/transformations options. We would still require use of 
          pubsub technology, but projects can commit into that their HTML, 
          either directly edited or dervied from markdown which they can keep
          in their project repo (some of the finer details will need to be 
          worked out later. This would essentially be the cheapest option,
          remove technical debt, and while the timeline would be many months
          contractor/volunteer time could be kept to a minimum.

Attachment I: Report from the Apache BookKeeper Project  [Ivan Kelly]

BookKeeper is a distributed, reliable, and high performance
logging service. The project also includes Hedwig which is
a highly scalable Pub/Sub service built on top of ZooKeeper
and BookKeeper with strong durability guarantees.

= Project Status =

We made a press release, announcing our move to TLP, through the
foundation on 2015-01-27. This triggered Yahoo to publish a blog post
about their internal usage of BookKeeper in their cloud messaging
service.

Development activity has been low this month, due to the committers
being occupied with other projects in their jobs. The two committers
who had been working for Yahoo, left the company in the January. As
Yahoo is one of the primary users of BookKeeper, it is bad that they
lack anyone internally to commit on the Apache project. We are
currently working on trying to find someone else to become a committer
from Yahoo.

= Releases =
Our last release was 4.2.4, released on 2015-01-22.

We are in the process of cutting a release for 4.3.1, which we expect
to release before the end of February

= Community Status =
There have been no committers added since we became TLP (2014-11-19).

The last committer added, when we were a subproject, was Rakesh
Radhakrishnan on 24th July 2014.

Attachment O: Report from the Apache Cocoon Project  [Thorsten Scherler]

Apache Cocoon 3 is a major rewrite of Cocoon 2.2. Like Cocoon 2 it is based
around the concept of pipelines and sitemaps and it is very similar to Cocoon
2.2 in many respects but is slimmed down and designed to be easily used with
Java code (= no frameworks required!).

On top of this, Cocoon 3 has the goal of becoming the best available platform
for RESTful webservices and web applications.

Attachment P: Report from the Apache Community Development Project  [Ulrich Stärk]

The Community Development PMC is responsible for helping people become
involved with Apache projects


Project Status
--------------

No issues require board attention at this time.

PMC changes
-----------

Daniel Gruno has been voted into the Community Development PMC on 2015-01-08.

Since artifacts produced by ComDev are usually documentation on our website
which is writable for all Apache committers, we usually do not add committers
to the ComDev project.

Google Summer of Code
---------------------

GSoC applications are open for organizations and the ASF will submit an
application again this year. A call for project ideas has been issued to
projects. Initial responses were low in numbers but in the meantime we have
gathered 88 project ideas at http://s.apache.org/gsoc2015ideas which should be
enough for getting started.

ComDev & Events
---------------

Most of the discussions on the dev@community.apache.org mailing list currently
revolve around ApacheCon 2015 in Austin with feedback and contributions coming
from all corners of the foundation.

Other
-----

Daniel Gruno is spearheading an overhaul of projects.apache.org. The current
work in progress is at https://projects-new.apache.org/.

Bertrand has initiated a discussion about a maturity model for our projects
that describes - on a high level - how our projects operate. A first version
can be found at
http://community.apache.org/apache-way/apache-project-maturity-model.html.

Attachment AB: Report from the Apache Falcon Project  [Srikanth Sundarrajan]

ABOUT
-----
Falcon is a data processing and management solution for Hadoop
designed for data motion, coordination of data pipelines,
lifecycle management, and data discovery. Falcon enables end
consumers to quickly onboard their data and its associated
processing and management tasks on Hadoop clusters.


ISSUES
------
There are no issues that require board's attention at this time.


STATUS
------
Falcon was accepted as a TLP in December 2014. During the last 30
days 33 new issues were created in the issue tracking system and
30 were closed during the same period. During the last month we
have witnessed good progress on the UI front for Falcon (FALCON-790).
With UI, we expect users to find it more easier to work with the
Falcon system. The community has been having regular bi-weekly
sync ups. These sync ups are being very helpful in steering the
project. Recipes (FALCON-634) and Lifecycle functions (FALCON-965)
would open up Falcon system for easy extensions and are being
actively worked upon besides other bug fixes. Community is also
discussing on mailing list on the way forward with respect to usage
of Apache Oozie for orchestration. The outcome will decide how
pipeline and lifecycle function orchestration will happen in
Falcon going forward. We also announced Falcon as a TLP in ASF
blog (http://s.apache.org/GT2)

Attachment AE: Report from the Apache Forrest Project  [David Crossley]

Apache Forrest mission is software for generation of aggregated multi-channel
documentation maintaining a separation of content and presentation.

Issues needing board attention:
  None.

Changes in the PMC membership:

  Last modified: 2013-04-08
  Most recent addition: 2009-06-09

New committers:
  None.
  Most recent addition: 2009-06-09

General status:
  The most recent release is 0.9 on 2011-02-07.

  No activity on the user mail list.

  There was more activity on the dev mail list.
  Two PMC members discussed a potential improvement and the originator
  did follow through. They also assisted each other with strange erroneous
  messages from Buildbot. An emeritus PMC member returned to make some
  changes as a committer, was welcomed, and two separate PMC members did
  followup queries.

  Just prior to report submission a discussion commenced about a potential
  new skin based on Bootstrap. 

  The Chair reminded the dev list that the project needs to make releases.

  The Chair replied to some obscure comment regarding the previous Board
  report, but there was no further followup (see 2014-11-25).

  At this quarter, 5 additional PMC members responded to my draft report.
  This confirms that there are sufficient people hanging around for us to
  potentially be able to make a decision or encourage new contributors.

Project status:
  Activity: Low.
  3+ people have indicated presence, so has sufficient oversight.

Security issues reported:
  None.

Progress of the project:
  Some improvements to i18n for the search box and the font size button.
  Minor tweaks to the i18n documentation.

  Some improvements to JavaScript handling.

  Infra advised us that the machine hosting the Forrest project's build and
  demo server is being decommissioned. One of our PMC members asked for a
  new VM via the issue INFRA-9093.

Attachment AN: Report from the Apache Incubator Project  [Roman Shaposhnik]

The Apache Incubator is the entry path into the ASF for projects and
codebases wishing to become part of the Foundation's efforts.

There are currently 35 podlings undergoing incubation.  One podling
(NPanday) has retired from the incubation.

The process of seeking nominations for the new IPMC Chair has concluded
and the voting shall begin soon.


* Community

  New IPMC members:

    none


  People who left the IPMC:

    none


* New Podlings

    none


* Graduations

  The board has motions for the following:
  
    none


* Releases

  The following releases were made since the last Incubator report:

    johnzon-0.5-incubating
    apache-reef-0.10.0-incubating
    htrace-3.1.0-incubating
    apache-usergrid-1.0.1-incubating
    nifi-nar-maven-plugin 1.0.0
    nifi 0.0.1 (incubating)
    streams-project-0.1-incubating

  The Incubator continues to use discretion when enforcing release policy.

  * Numerous releases have been approved despite having an out of date
    copyright year in the NOTICE file.  Fixing for the next release has been
    considered a sufficient remedy.
  * The REEF release was approved with an incomplete incubation
    disclaimer in README (there was also a disclaimer on the podling
    website).

* IP Clearance

  CouchDB Mango -- IBM Corporation have built a MongoDB API Layer for
  CouchDB and are donating it to the CouchDB project. This consists of of a
  module that exposes a set of actions that are similar to what MongoDB
  exposes.

* Legal / Trademarks

  Taverna successfully cleared its name search.

--------------------
Corinthia

Corinthia is a toolkit/application for converting between and editing common
office file formats, with an initial focus on word processing. It is
designed to cater for multiple classes of platforms - desktop, web, and
mobile - and relies heavily on web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and
JavaScript for representing and manipulating documents. The toolkit is
small, portable, and flexible, with minimal dependencies. The target
audience is developers wishing to include office viewing, conversion, and
editing functionality into their applications.

Corinthia has been incubating since 2014-12-08.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Discuss and decide on a medium-term roadmap
  2. Grow the community
  3. Finalize source structure change (easy access for new developers)

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  none

    Still a new podling, growing pretty well though.  Small number of
    participants that may need further growth to be viable long term.

--------------------
Droids

Droids aims to be an intelligent standalone robot framework that allows to
create and extend existing droids (robots).

Droids has been incubating since 2008-10-09.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Activity
  2. Name Search

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  None.

  We need to continue the name search. Branding has replied to the issue and
  provided additional searches that need to performed. It is hoped that
  these can be finished in the new couple weeks.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  No change.

--------------------
HTrace

HTrace is a tracing framework intended for use with distributed systems
written in java.

HTrace has been incubating since 2014-11.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Continue to grow the HTrace community
  2. Continue to develop and release stable HTrace incubating artifacts
  3. Continue to explore the integration of the HTrace framework into other
     Apache products

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  Around January 20th HTrace successfully made the first release whilst in
  the Apache Incubator.  This was the outcomes of no-less than 10 release
  candidates and as many VOTE's.  In all every release candidate was very
  well managed with HTrace community providing excellent feedback to the
  release manager. Rather than then entire 10 release candidate exercise
  being a pain point for the community, it appears to have strengthened all
  involved. Well done HTrace.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  It is early incubating days for HTrace. The community has attracted in
  particular a new member who is doing a sterling job on a new UI for
  HTrace. Additionally it should be noted that the entire
  htrace-3.1.0-incubating release effort has certainly brought the existing
  community on leaps and bounds.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  The project has progressed significantly. In fact, it was highlighted on
  at least one occasion that documentation supporting a release candidate
  should be further clarified/improved due to the dynamic progressive nature
  of the HTrace codebase. As an early incubating project this is accepted as
  a positive move.

Shepherd/Mentor notes:

  Matthew B. Franklin (mfranklin):

    Lot's of code is being committed to the project, but mostly by a couple of
    developers.  There also does not appear to be much discussion on the list
    in last period, likely  due to the low number of developers.

    I recommend the podling focus on increasing the size and participation of
    the community as one of the issues to address prior to graduation.

--------------------
Slider

Slider is a collection of tools and technologies to package, deploy, and
manage long running applications on Apache Hadoop YARN clusters.

Slider has been incubating since 2014-04-29.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Building a diverse developer and user community
  2. Achieving broader adoption of the existing code and slider-deployable
     applications (examples: HBase, Accumulo)
  3. Making slider better at deploying other applications, so improving
     takeup.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  None

How has the community developed since the last report?

  We're getting more people on the mailing list asking for improvements;
  anyone with a patch is being helped to get it in. That builds up the
  developer base and is intended to move it from a single team to one
  distributed community development.  As we grow, we're proposing moving
  from a single slider developer list to:a separate user mailing list, and a
  third list for the JIRA/svn/git events. This will focus the developer list
  around discussion, with a user list to help build that user community. We
  do of course expect developers to also subscribe to the user list.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  We've done a source-only release in November, 0.60.0-incubating, in sync
  with features in Hadoop 2.6, with a binary packing version,
  0.61.0-incubating has just been voted for release (3-feb 2015); the
  incubator vote is now pending. It was nice to see tests and a vote on the
  release from an external user & patch submitter -community engagement
  includes things like this.

  A new release, 0.70 is being created with the release planned
  mid-February. This will include improved features and fixes —especially
  those reported by users of the 0.60 release. For example, one group wanted
  short-lived applications on secure clusters, instances where Slider does
  not need to worry about keytab expiry. Another need of people writing
  slider-deployed applications was for a placement policy of "only ever ask
  for component placement where instances were before"; this is needed for
  Kafka.

  Some of the feature requests are quite "ambitious", especially those
  related to deployed components providing information back to the Web/REST
  GUIs, and extending the configuration model to include: more
  on-target-machine configuration, per-instance configuration and better
  strategies for placing components within the YARN cluster. These requests
  do represent real needs; even if they are long term features we need to
  think about how to get there.

  We're discussing supplementing the dev@ mailing list with issues@ and
  user@ lists; the issues list for all JIRA updates -creation and completion
  would still go to the developer list. This is to separate the noise of
  JIRA-centric development from a developer list focused on broader
  application features and building a community. We don't want to scare
  people off from too much JIRA, or worse: lose what they have to say in the
  emails. Similarly, the user@ list is where we want to encourage users. The
  original rationale for a single list was "one single community
  discussion", but it's not clear its worked out that way.

Date of last release:

  2014-11: Slider 0.60 (source, against Hadoop 2.6)
  2015-02: (vote in progress) Slider 0.61.0 (binary, against Hadoop 2.6)

TinkerPop

TinkerPop is a graph computing framework written in Java

TinkerPop has been incubating since 2015-01-16.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Software grant needs to be approved.
  2. Migration to Apache infrastructure.
  3. Getting our team comfortable with the new environment.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  We have been hanging on the software grant approval for a week now. Be
  good to get that knocked out so we can move forward.

Attachment AO: Report from the Apache JMeter Project  [Sebastian Bazley]

The Apache JMeter application is a pure Java application designed to load test
functional behavior and measure performance.

JMeter 2.12 was released on 10th November 2014.

The JMeter user list is active and user requests are generally dealt with
promptly, either by other members of the community or the JMeter developers.

Likewise the developer list, though of course that is mainly used by the
committers.

We received many patches from external contributors during the end of last
year period. JMeter is being increasingly used in different commercial
offers ranging from Cloud SAAS to commercial plugins.

We recently welcomed Andrey Pokhilko and Mikhail Epikhin as new committers.
A proposal to a 3rd committer is still waiting for an answer from his side.

Rahul Akolkar resigned from the PMC on 20th January 2015.
Felix Schumacher joined the PMC on Feb 3rd 2015

The JMeter Twitter account has 1564 followers as of 4th Feb 2015.

Attachment AS: Report from the Apache Lenya Project  [Richard Frovarp]

The Apache Lenya CMS is a Cocoon based XML/XHTML content management
system.

Issues:

The board submitted several questions to the PMC after the last report.

1) No commits
  - It appears that there are few places using Lenya yet. Most of the
    previous committers have moved their development efforts on to new
    places
2) No releases
  - There haven't been any releases as there haven't been any commits
    that have warrented a new release. So while there are the PMC numbers
    to vote on a release, no one has fealt that unreleased changes are
    worth a release.
3) Questions on the list
  - Questions aren't being asked, so they aren't being answered. Queries
    to the list aren't being ignored.

The board follow up sparked conversation on list about options. It seems
that the community feels that it is a good time to move to the attic.

A formal vote on the resolution will be held. The voting time as per the
Lenya guidelines would call for a one week voting period. That means
that the resolution, if passed, would appear on next months agenda.

Development:

No new releases this quarter.
Last release: 2.0.4 on 2011-03-14

Community:

Last change to community was PMC addition in October 2011.

Activity:

Another quarter of almost no activity.

Attachment AV: Report from the Apache Mahout Project  [Grant Ingersoll]

=== Apache Mahout Status Report: February (missed January) 2015 ===

-----

Apache Mahout has implementations of a wide range of machine learning and
data mining algorithms: clustering, classification, collaborative filtering
and frequent pattern mining

Project Status
--------------

The project continues to have a large and active user base.  Development
continues by a small number of dedicated individuals.  The PMC is reviewing
how we can improve contributions as well as exploring other options to make
sure the project remains viable to the user base.


Community
---------

* As per the status, the main issue is we have only 2-3 committers who are
contributing on a regular basis.  While they are doing good work, it is
concerning from a sustainment issue.  We are discussing as a PMC how
to rectify this situation.  The main issue is that developing machine learning
libraries is involved process that is hard to do on a part time basis and
we have yet to find anyone that can be dedicated full time to the project.



Community Objectives
--------------------

Identify next steps for either growing the list of active committers or
finding an appropriate home for the code that exists (attic or elsewhere).


Releases
--------

The migration to Spark is still ongoing and no new releases are planned at this
time.


Issues

Attachment AW: Report from the Apache ManifoldCF Project  [Karl Wright]

ManifoldCF PMC Chair: Karl Wright (kwright@apache.org)
Date: February 2015

Project description
==============

ManifoldCF is an effort to provide an open source framework for connecting
source content repositories like Microsoft Sharepoint and EMC Documentum, to
target repositories or indexes, such as Apache Solr, OpenSearchServer or
ElasticSearch. ManifoldCF also defines a security model for target
repositories that permits them to enforce source-repository security policies.

Releases
========

ManifoldCF graduated from the Apache Incubator on May 16, 2012.  Since then,
there have been ten major releases, including a 1.8 and 2.0 release on
December 26, 2014, and a corresponding pair of point releases on February 3,
2015.  The next major release is scheduled for April 30, 2015.

ManifoldCF is now in the position of supporting both a legacy set of releases
(1.x), and a non-backwards-compatible set of releases (2.x).  We plan to
continue this dual support for a period of roughly one year.

Committers and PMC membership
=============================

The last committer we signed up was Alessandro Benedetti (abenedetti), on
October 10, 2014.

Mailing list activity
=====================

Mailing list has been somewhat less active than last quarter, but still
robust.  Most of our connectors now have significant use cases and
constituencies.  Dev list comments for this period centered around the
ManifoldCF 2.0 release.  There were plenty of people looking for integration
advice as well.  I am unaware of any mailing-list question that has gone
unanswered.

Outstanding issues
==================

Release upload to the dist.apache.org svn repository is quite slow, and takes
well over an hour for a single ManifoldCF release candidate.  We raised this
issue with Infra but did not manage to resolve it.

Branding
========

We have reviewed the site branding guidelines and believe we are now compliant
with these, with the possible exception of (TM) signs in logos from other
Apache products that don't have any such marks.  Hopefully we will be able to
correct this issue soon.

Community

The Roller community is small but active these days, busy with a new
release and fielding support questions about that release.

The last new PMC member and committer who joined is Gaurav Saini
who joined on July 3, 2014.

This quarter, like most recent quarters, there has been a slow but steady
stream of bug fixes, re-factorings and improvements to the Roller code
base, documentation and the wiki.

Attachment BQ: Report from the Apache Santuario Project  [Colm O hEigeartaigh]

The Apache Santuario project is aimed at providing implementation of
security standards for XML.

The PMC continues to actively manage the project, and there are no issues or
concerns to report to the board at this time.

There were two new bug-fix releases of the Apache XML Security for Java
project over the last quarter, 2.0.3 and 1.5.8. There were 25 commits to the
trunk branch of the Java project over the last quarter.

Development on a patch release for the C++ library addressing a number of
accumulated bug reports over the last year or two is complete, and the
release should be completed some time in March.

Last committer addition: Marc Giger, July 2012.
Last PMC addition: Marc Giger, April 2013.

Attachment BR: Report from the Apache SIS Project  [Adam Estrada]

Apache SIS is a spatial framework that enables better representation of
coordinates for searching, data clustering, archiving, or any other
relevant spatial needs.

Development:
 Started the port of the framework to be used for map projections.

 Work by newly added committer (Marc Le Bihan in November) on Shapefile
format.

Community:
Following on the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) meeting in December, OGC
would like to start a discussion with a larger community about geospatial
API. One reason is the fact that many projects take the XSD published by OGC
(e.g. [1]) as a starting point, then translate them to Java API using JAXB or
Eclipse. The result is a hardly usable API, but those projects continue to
use this approach. Apache SIS is one of the few projects trying to push for
standardization by OGC of a clean Java API. Consequently we are invited to
speak again about this issue in the next OGC meeting (March), to a wider
audience than previous meeting.

Branding:
Community board report drafts are now on Google Docs and available to those
who have the URL [2]

Issues:
New PMC member (Marc Le Bihan) still not added to the LDAP. Attempts by
Martin Desruisseaux and Adam Estrada to execute “modify_committee.pl sis
-add=mlebihan” resulted in following error message:

Insufficient access at /usr/local/bin/modify_group_members.pl line 102
modify_group_members.pl failed: 255

The Maven snapshot repositories [3] is polluted with old releases. A JIRA
task has been filled to INFRA for this issue [4], but the task has been
closed without being actually fixed. We apparently do not have the karma to
reopen the task. But the issue is not SIS-specific anyway. More generally:
how do we cleanup the snapshot repository after a release? We mean, how to
delete all “0.5-SNAPSHOT” artifacts after the version number has been
increased to “0.6-SNAPSHOT”?

Releases:
SIS 0.5 release this week (around February 11th). We are late on the
schedule, both on the release time (it was initially planned for December)
and on the release content (it contains only a fraction of what we said would
be in Apache SIS 0.5). Consequently this release is more like a milestone
than a full-featured release.

Press:
None

Attachment BS: Report from the Apache Spark Project  [Matei Zaharia]

Apache Spark is a fast and general engine for large-scale data processing. It 
offers high-level APIs in Java, Scala, and Python as well as a rich set of
libraries including stream processing, machine learning, and graph analytics. 

Project status: 

- We posted our 1.2.0 release in December, with contributions from 172
developers. Major features included stable APIs for Spark's graph
processing module (GraphX), a high-level pipeline API for machine
learning, an external data source API, better H/A for streaming, and
networking performance optimizations.

- We posted the Spark 1.2.1 maintenance release on February 9th, with
contributions from 69 developers.

- We cut a release branch and started QA for Spark 1.3.0, which should
be released sometime in March. Some features coming there include a
data frame API similar to R and Python, write support for external data
sources, and quite a few new machine learning algorithms.

- We had a discussion about adding a committer role to the project that
is separate from PMC (before, Spark had PMC = C) to bring in people
sooner, and decided to do that from this point on.

Releases: 

Our last few releases were: 

February 9, 2015: Spark 1.2.1
December 18, 2014: Spark 1.2.0
November 26, 2014: Spark 1.1.1
September 11, 2014: Spark 1.1.0

The last committers were added February 2nd, 2015
(Joseph Bradley, Cheng Lian and Sean Owen)

The last PMC members were added August 12th, 2014
(Joseph Gonzalez and Andrew Or).

Attachment BU: Report from the Apache Subversion Project  [Greg Stein]

Apache Subversion exists to be universally recognized and adopted as
an open-source, centralized version control system characterized by
its reliability as a safe haven for valuable data; the simplicity of
its model and usage; and its ability to support the needs of a wide
variety of users and projects, from individuals to large-scale
enterprise operations.

* Board Issues

  There are no Board-level issues of concern.

* Community

  The community is getting ready to branch 1.9.x as part of our
  release process. Assuming the branch occurs in the next week or two,
  then the release should appear late March or early April.
  
  There is some planning in-process for a Subversion hackathon to
  occur around the same time as ApacheCon (Austin).
  
  Mailing list activity:
  
    users@ (779 subscribers): 390 messages across Nov/Dec/Jan.
    dev@ (330 subscribers): 583 messages across Nov/Dec/Jan.

  Our last PMC addition was February 2014, and our last (non-PMC)
  committer was added in July 2013.

* Releases

  The project made two releases to resolve CVE-2014-3580 and
  CVE-2014-8108:

    1.7.19 -- Prior series, receives maintenance/security patches,
              released on December 15, 2014
  
  Information about our 1.9.x releases should be present in our next
  quarterly report.

Attachment BV: Report from the Apache Syncope Project  [Francesco Chicchiricco]

Apache Syncope is an Open Source system for managing digital identities in
enterprise environments, implemented in JEE technology.

Status

There are no outstanding issues requiring board attention.


Community

The mailing lists' traffic has returned quite stable, the number of subscribers
to user@ and dev@ has again slightly increased if compared to last quarter.

New and coming users are asking for support and reporting bugs; in some cases
patches are also provided, fact that can constitute ground for discussion about
inviting new committers.

Besides bugfixing of current stable release from the 1_2_X branch, we have
started a deep code re-organization towards next stable release, which will
also include a consistent contribution we received lately about integration
with Camel.

The PMC has briefly discussed in January about the opportunity to rotate the
PMC chair; such discussion brought anyway to confirmation of the current chair.

Last committer addition (Giacomo Lamonaco) is dated January 2015.
Last addition to PMC (Guido Wimmel) is dated April 2014.


Releases since last report

       * 1.2.1 (Nov 17th, 2014)

Attachment BY: Report from the Apache TomEE Project  [David Blevins]

Apache TomEE delivers enterprise application containers and services
based on, but not limited to the Enterprise JavaBeans Specification
and Java Enterprise Edition Specifications.

Work on TomEE 2.0 has slowed.  The 2.x branch now passes the Java EE 6
Web Profile TCK, however work towards Java EE 7 compliance is
understandably difficult.  The 2.x branch now passes the CDI 1.2 TCK,
which is openly available from RedHat.  Some work has been done to
integrate ActiveMQ 6 into TomEE 2.x.  The community is running out of
threads to pull on Java EE 7 without a TCK.

Meanwhile the TomEE 1.7.x branch remains the center of the day-to-day.
A version 1.7.2 is likely to come out in the next quarter.  This will
be the first release since the project switched from SVN to Git.  The
change in SCM went fairly smooth despite the kind of "the rails are
off" discussions that arise from being now largely unrestricted.  The
community is trying out various Git flows.  This will probably
continue for quite a while before the dust truly settles.

Website traffic still slowly increasing and at an overall high of
around 72k visits/month.  User list traffic stable compared to the
last 6 months, but down from last year.  This would seem to be
indicative of a community in stabilizing/maintenance mode, but growing
popularity.

Last release was 1.7.1 on 2014-09-15.  Last committer was added
November 2013.  Last PMC addition was 2010-08-26.

Attachment CD: Report from the Apache Xalan Project  [Steven J. Hathaway]

The Apache Xalan Project develops and maintains libraries and programs 
that transform XML documents using XSLT standard stylesheets. Our subprojects 
use the Java and C++ programing languages to implement the XSLT libraries. 

Xalan is a mature project, but we are hoping to acquire more committers
who can upgrade the project to address the newer XPath and XSLT standards.

ISSUES FOR THE BOARD
  None.

CURRENT ACTIVITY

Xalan is a mature product.  There is little development activity other
than patch maintenance.  Most of the activity is in the Xalan-J subproject.

The Incubator Corinthia project since ApacheCon EU 2014 has been soliciting
expertise from Xalan.  We are providing what we can with limited resources.

We are planning an appearance at ApacheCon NA 2015.

MEMBERSHIP

Changes in the PMC membership:
  None.

Last new committer:
  May 2014

PROJECT RELEASES

Xalan Java 2.7.2  April 15, 2014
Xalan C/C++ 1.11  October 31, 2012

Publishing of project releases was refreshed Oct 30, 2014.

OTHER ISSUES

Moving the original XML parent project to the Attic has caused some
frustration on the mailing lists, but these have mostly been overcome.
We still get messages posted to the old XML project with Xalan 
as subprojects.  Moderating these messages has helped.

No new issues regarding moving original XML parent project to the attic
have occurred.

We still have enough active members to vote on releases and other PMC issues.

BRANDING ISSUES
  None.

==XML GRAPHICS COMMONS==
0 commits to SVN this quarter.

There were no releases this quarter

The latest release is 2.0 (3 October 2014)

==FOP==
19 separate commits to SVN. These are mostly bug fixes (including a couple
of patches from the community); but also includes the completion of the
fo:float feature by Luis Bernardo. This is a major milestone for the FOP
project as it represents the implementation of one of the last remaining
significant XSL-FO features. The next release (planned to be 2.0) is
currently dependent on the completion of the release of the Batik sub
project.

The FOP User list has a slow but steady stream of questions being raised
and answered; 75 e-mails in total.

There were no releases this quarter

The latest release is 1.1 (20 October 2012)

==BATIK==
49 separate commits to SVN. This breaks down into some feature development
for Complex Script support, and some bug fixing in preparation for the
release. There were some discussions about starting the release, but the
Complex Script development is still in progress. The decision is to wait
for this to be completed. The mailing lists are fairly quiet, with only 8
e-mails to the users list this quarter.

There was an e-mail received on January 23, 2015 Entitled: Vulnerability in
Apache Batik Framework (Responsible Disclosure). The team has discussed
this vulnerability, and we’ve contacted our primary Batik developer. One
committer has agreed to review & commit a PATCH as soon as one has been
submitted. We hope to have this issue resolved as quickly as possible.

There were no releases this quarter.

The latest version is 1.7 (6 January 2008)
