# Reads LDAP ou=projects and committee-info
#
# Previously read LDAP ou=pmc,ou=committees,ou=groups,dc=apache,dc=org
# but this is deprecated.
# The output is intended to include the same entries as before;
#Â as such it includes tac and security even though they are not PMCs
#
# Creates JSON output with the following format:
#
# {
#   "lastTimestamp": "20160119171152Z", // most recent modifyTimestamp
#   "committees": {
#     "abdera": {
#       "modifyTimestamp": "20111204095436Z",
#       "roster": ["uid",
#       ...
#       ]
#     },
#     ...
#   },
# }
