This Whimsy Roster tool presents a variety of organizational data about 
people and groups at the ASF in a convenient and secure manner. 
It uses Rack and Sinatra to run the server, Wunderbar for output, and 
the whimsy/asf library to directly access a variety of ASF data 
sources and files.

A public-facing version of some of this data is here:
  https://whimsy.apache.org/foundation/orgchart/

Note that public_*.rb scripts are run by cron on the whimsy.a.o 
server and control generating the /public/*.json files.

Run Roster Locally :car:
===

To test locally, run:

    rake server

If you are running commands/actions that require authentication, start your
sever using:

    rake auth server

Doing so will prompt you for your ASF password.  Should your ASF username
not match your local user name, set the `USER` environment variable to your
apache user id before running the above command.

Issues?  [Local setup](../../DEVELOPMENT.md#running-whimsy-applications-car).

Architecture Overview
===

The roster tool primarily displays data from a variety of sources 
(private and public), and in some cases allows self-service for 
Apache committers to update data directly.

* config.ru and main.rb are the startup and central control.

* models/ obviously provide the data models; many of them mirror but 
  add functionality to some of the whimsy/asf models.
  
* views/ provide the individual view pages.html.rb and (when used) 
  associated pages.js.rb scripts that make interactive features work,
  using React.js.

* lib/whimsy/asf/auth is used by a few tools to do specific authorization 
  steps **within** the tool - instead of simply relying on httpd 
  to gate access to a URL as a whole.
