# Reads LDAP ou=projects and extracts member rosters for PMCs
# (PMC status comes from committee-info.txt)
#
# Also reads LDAP ou=groups,dc=apache,dc=org to extract some non-PMCs
# This is to maintain compatibility with earlier output
#
# The contents cannot be used to determine LDAP group membership
#
# Creates JSON output with the following format:

# {
#   "lastTimestamp": "20160119171152Z", // most recent modifyTimestamp
