to the #{pmc.name} project.

You can read more about what the expectations are for committers here:
http://www.apache.org/dev/committers.html#committer-responsibilities

These privileges are offered on the understanding that you'll use them
reasonably and with common sense. We like to work on trust rather than
unnecessary constraints.

Being a committer enables you to more easily make changes without needing to
go through the patch submission process.

Being a committer does not require you to participate any more than you already
do, but it does tend to make one even more committed ;-) You will probably find
that you spend more time here.
