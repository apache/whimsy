Dear <%= @fullname %>,

Welcome to membership in The Apache Software Foundation.

This message acknowledges receipt of your membership application, which has been filed in the Apache Software Foundation records.

You will shortly be subscribed to the members@apache.org mailing list using your <%= @email %> address.

You will also be subscribed to the members-notify@apache.org mailing list.
This is a very low traffic list which is used for essential (legally required) notices to members.

Note: you are allowed to unsubscribe from members-notify@ (ie. it is opt-out after your initial subscription).

HOWEVER, doing so constitutes a "Waiver of Notice", per section 3.6 of the Bylaws.
https://www.apache.org/foundation/bylaws.html#3.6

If you need to change your email subscriptions, please visit https://whimsy.apache.org/committers/subscribe

To verify that you have the proper rights to the foundation repository, please check that you have been added to the members roster:
https://svn.apache.org/repos/private/foundation/members.txt

You can use Whimsy to check your settings:
https://whimsy.apache.org/roster/committer/__self__

Under 'Groups' you should see 'member'; this gives you access to member-only resources.
Note that it may take a while for all systems to pick up the new setting.

You can also use your Whimsy profile page to complete your personal profile, by updating the section of your profile under "Members.txt".

All Members have read access to all "Members.txt" information, including your postal address, phone number, projects, personal web page, etc.

Note that some of the information is considered Personally Identifiable Information, and you do not have to share any information you are not comfortable with.

Thus, you can update the section of your profile under "Members.txt" to remove information, as long as you leave Name, Forms on File, and Avail ID fields.

If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to reach out at members@apache.org

Warm Regards,

<%= @sig %>
